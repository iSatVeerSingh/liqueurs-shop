    "description": "Queen's Share rum was known to be the best barrels in a distillery and reserved for royalties special occasions. It takes meticulous distilling, additional cut collection, re-distillation, and extended aging to fulfill it’s promise of dense flavor and plush texture. Sadly it became a victim of bottom lines and large volume manufacturing. Privateer Rum takes great pride in being a part of this traditional rum's revival.\nPrivateer’s Queen’s Share rum is made from the richest cuts of their rum distillation. In every distillation there are traditionally three main cuts. The \"heads\", harsh alcohols unwanted in your final spirit cut, come off of the still first. The \"hearts\" follow; this is the flavorful rum that is collected and bottled as Privateer New England White Rum, Privateer True American Amber and Privateer Navy Yard. Lastly, the \"tails\" cut is made to separate the hearts from the bitter alcohols at the end of the still run.\n\nHowever, as the hearts run is approaching the tails cut, the spirit becomes more powerful and flavorful. Even once these tails have overpowered the hearts and they've made their cut, some of these rich hearts are still intertwined with the bitter tails. At this stage, Privateer distillers collect a fourth cut- a blend of rich hearts mixed with tails otherwise known as the \"seconds\". These small amounts are collected over many runs and redistilled together, liberating the hearts. This creates a single batch, single barrel expression of Queen’s Share rum.",

    "description": "Privateer was founded in 2011 by Andrew Cabot, and the distillery is located in Boston, Massachusetts. Under the guidance of master distiller, Maggie Campbell, the distillery has true emphasis on craft production. It uses only Grade A (also known as “Fancy”) US molasses, and for its white rum single origin molasses from one valley in Guatemala. The rum is double distilled, first in a thousand-gallon Vendome pot, then in a copper eau-de-vie still, a hybrid pot/column still with an adjustable plate configuration. It is then bottled in accordance with the Bottled in Bond Act of 1897, which was intended for American whiskey, but ensures the spirit blended is from one distillery and produced in a single distilling season. This transparent approach has won Privateer a loyal following of connoisseurs and collectors alike among its fans.\n\nThe Queen's Share is a revival of an historic style of rum, produced by introducing an additional cut between the heart and the tails, containing some of the richest spirits but also many heavy spirits from the tails. After collecting several such cuts from numerous batches of each of its spirit runs, which then includes a variety of sugarcane strains, the liquid is re-distilled to remove the overly heavy tails spirits from the heart. The resultant liquid is destined to become The Queen's Share. \n\nLetter of Marque is a range of single barrel releases for various US groups, retailers and bars.\n\nThis particular bottling was aged 5 years, finished in a bourbon barrel and produced exclusively for K&L",

    "description": "\"Founded more than a decade ago by California surfer Rodney “Rod” Cegelski, and Aussie Hamish “Hammer” Marshall, Rod & Hammer's Slo Stills crafts American spirits. The story of Slo Stills began in 1988 at the Slo Brew brewery. In 2012 they distilled and aged their first whiskey, a rye beer mash made in the original Garden street copper kettle. They realize that the most important ingredient and the crucial part of distilling is time ― hence the name. Their other not-so-secret ingredient is purified oceanic water, as every spirit of theirs is cut with Pacific Ocean water. \"\"California meets Australia,\"\" as they say.\n\nDried & malted grains are milled, exposing the starches within. Then they add water, cooking the mash in order to convert those starches to sugars. Yeast is then added to the wort in fermenting tanks, starting the fermentation process that converts the sugars to alcohol, and turns the wort into beer. This beer is then distilled. The resultant spirit is then transferred to charred new American Oak barrels. Before bottling the spirit is filtered and brought to proof with purified oceanic water.",

Recently, we became intrigued with applying the concept of “Dovetail” to some of our older stocks. The result is BCS Gray Label Dovetail, which still boasts our award-winning blend of Whiskey finished in rum, port, and Dunn Vineyards cabernet barrels and uses the same finishing and blending method. The difference, as with all our Gray Label offerings, is that we used older and more rare barrels in Gray Label Dovetail. The result harmoniously unites a dark and fruity California cabernet finish, a jammy and pleasurable port finish, and a sweet and funky rum finish to create a well-balanced, iconic whiskey. The component whiskeys are aged up to 20 years, making the final blend significantly more elegant.\n\n​\n\nAn ester-forward bourbon with the brooding depth of cabernet and port casks.

One of the oddities of the Scottish whisky industry has been the release of several American whiskies from Bourbon mashbills aged partially in Europe. These weird wonderful whiskies have been released by famous names like Cadenhead's and The Boutique-y Whiskey Company, but we've rarely seen these unusual products imported back into the US. Now, thanks to our relationship with the wonderful team being Archives, we've secured one of just a handful of these excellent Heaven Hill barrels that have made their way back into the US. There are huge differences in maturation between Scotland and Kentucky, but there's still something inherently bourbon-y about this special spirit. This whisky spent six years in Kentucky in used cooperage before making the journey to Scotland four 4 more years. The aromatics still rest resoundingly in the sweet orchard fruit and vanilla, but instead of caramel and spice, it's ripe, fresh fruit. Instead of Pungent and smoky, the vanilla is subtle and floral. Behind the pretty aromatics are powerful exotic flavors. At an impressive 133.2 proof you’d expect the heat to be overwhelming without the sweetness of new oak, but this remains surprisingly supple and drinkable. We do recommend a splash of water and while it’s provenance is unusual, it remains a distinctly American spirit unlike any other.",

Through the stark landscape of authentic KSCW, we encourage you to venture into this pristine territory shepherded by an experienced guide, Hirsch Selection. KSCW is the predecessor to bourbon whiskey, which has at least 51% corn in the mash bill. Only when the corn content is at least 80% can a whiskey be designated as corn whiskey. Authentic whiskey selection is a recognizable strength of Preiss Imports. The Hirsch Selection hand picked series of single barrel whiskies is chosen expressly for connoisseurs of small batch fine spirits.

He is building an extraordinary distillery on Mare Island, just west of Vallejo in an old U.S. Naval Yard that that was responsible, among other things, for building submarines and loading ships during WWII. Both of the distillery's whiskies are finished in Dave's wine barrels from his Napa Valley winery and have received great acclaim. We traveled to Mare Island to meet up with the Master Distiller and Blender, Jordan Via, to put together a bespoke barrel of whiskey for K&L. The result is Savage and Cooke's first ever cask strength release and it's a doozy. While the OB's from the distillery are both currently finished in Dave's Cabernet barrels, they do have whiskey resting in other wine casks. There was no way we were going to pass up the opportunity to showcase what a whiskey can do with barrels from the world's most famous Zinfandel producer! The Zinfandel finish showed most prominently in the Second Glance whiskey so we started there. While the 100% Zin was excellent, it needed just a touch of something else. The dark fruit and spice of the Zinfandel played perfectly with the floral and jammy flavors and lifted nature of the Grenache. Ultimately we settled on an 80% Zin, 20% Grenache blend and it's perfect. Grab this piece of history before it's gone. 95% Corn, 4% Rye, 1% Malted Barley.",

Then, each batch is bottled by hand.\n\nStranahan's Colorado Whiskey has an aroma of tangerines, roasted nuts, peppers and spices that gives way to notes of tobacco, chewy leather, maple syrup and honeyed caramel on the palate.

It is made today with the same production methods that our family used to make tequila, over one hundred and forty years ago! We select each agave for ripeness before it is harvested, and cook them by steam in our small brick oven. We then use a two-ton stone wheel called a tahona to slowly squeeze the juices from the agave. After adding water from the volcanic mountain of Tequila and separating the fibers, we ferment the musto for 3 to 5 days. When fermentation is complete, we achieve our distinctive tequila by distilling twice in two very small, copper-pot stills.\n\nFortaleza Añejo is aged for 18 months is used American Whiskey barrels. The extra time spent aging in these barrels impart deeper, richer, and warmer tones than our reposado. Common aromas and flavors found in our añejo are: Cooked Agave, Sweet Butter, Butterscotch, Caramel, Vanilla, Citrus, Dried Fruit, Tropical Fruit, Cinnamon, White Pepper, Cloves, Nuts, and Dry Earth.\n\nAll of our tequilas are deliciously wonderful and complex, and can be enjoyed neat, or in a cocktail!",

    "description": "Made with California apples and aged over 21 years in French oak, this is a surprisingly lively and taut apple brandy. Expect fresh and juiced apple and racy Granny Smith acidity. The finish is long and mouthwatering, with ginger and prickly white pepper sparks slicked with a gloss of vanilla. The nose is an enigma; it smells like an incredible mix of Calvados, delicate yet well-aged Scotch, Junmai Daiginjo sake, and warm apple pie. The complexity is through the roof. It's easy to casually enjoy, and yet it requires a focused study to draw out all the nuance—personally one of my favorite characteristics in a spirit. If I can crush a glass or two without paying attention OR choose to dive deep into finer points of delicate aromatics and textures, I’m sold. The color is a stunning golden straw. The easy and obvious cinnamon and apple notes on the nose give way to subtle vanilla, stone fruit, umami koji, annatto, and roasted nuts. The palate, beginning with the sweet flavors of a freshly baked apple pie – flaky crust and all – eventually gives way to orange zest, nutmeg, raisins, and subtle oxidation reminiscent of a glorious Amontillado. It would have been easy to bottle this at 40% like so many brandies, but the choice to keep the proof high at 44% was an excellent one. The added punch and power will appeal to those whiskey fans that love cask-strength bottlings, but it still really allows the 2+ decades of flavor development to shine through without overpowering the fruit.",

The family Poyferre has found success in France in top restuarants and bottle shops, but is not widely distributed stateside and remains a hidden gem here. This family, the same that once owned the excellent Chateau Leoville-Poyferre, commercialize their Armagnacs more as family tradition than a profit-making endeavor. In fact, 100% of the profits from selling Armagnac are returned to the upkeep of the historic estate where they're made, and the owners squeeze the brandy production in amongst other business endeavors. The Barons of Poyferre have owned the estate since 1880 and produced Armagnac there since at least 1887. It is one of the most strikingly beautiful estates in the region and boasts traditional chai as well as an underground humid cellar. Considering the commitment to tradition and quality, these brandies should be significantly more expensive. However, thanks to our direct relationship with them, these remain some of the best values around. If you're looking for Boingniere quality at Tenareze prices, look no further than the fabulous Domaine de Jouanda. We tasted through nearly their entire cellar and selected the finest casks we could locate. These brandies have been minimally aerated and are proper single vintage single cask bottlings at their natural alcohol strengths.",

The firm was started in 1935 by Madame Jeanne Goudoulin who, following the unexpected death of her husband Joseph from injuries sustained during the first world war, began selling his Armagnacs directly from the family property, Domaine de Bigor. As the years passed, the Goudoulin Armagnacs began reaching a larger audience, making their way to the Basque coast and Bordeaux. In 1964, Jeanne's grandson Christian Faure entered the business and began expanding the négociant side, establishing contracts with growers and marketing their products under the Veuve Goudoulin name. In 1977, the Veuve (widow in French) died, and in 1983, Faure constructed a new chai to house his Armagnacs, now called the Clos du Presbytere. Vintages from the 60s, 70s, and 80s tend to come from the border of the Gers and Les Landes, near the towns of Parlebosq, Cazaubon, and Gabarret.",

We're extremely lucky to have stumbled upon them and this first parcel that they acquired from the famous estate in the best part of the Ténarèze. We first visited Domaine Pouchegu in 2013, where Pierre Laporte was matter of fact about what made his Armagnacs so good: great care in the vines, a good amount of sable fauve in the soils, hiring the best distiller, and a commitment to purchasing high-quality, new Limousin oak every vintage. His meticulous attention to detail was obvious the moment we first tasted those special brandies. What we didn't know at the time was that this master of the art was battling cancer. Less than a year after that first meeting, Mr. Laporte had succumbed to cancer. His illness had not been a secret, but we did not realize the severity of the condition. Since then, his brandies have become legendary among our customers and beyond. After repeated attempts to contact his successors, our friend Charles Neal sent us word that he'd located the stocks. Luckily for us they were still in barrel and unblemished by low-quality blending or adjustment of any kind. The Rare Armagnac Collection is bottled without additives or reduction. Unfortunately, this bottle does not have Mr. Laporte's name or his domaine on it, but these bottlings perfectly preserve that man's incredible legacy.",

    "description": "The Foursquare Rum Distillery (and Heritage Park) is located in the south of Barbados. It is owned by the Seale family, whose 5 generations of rum-making expertise have followed since 1820. It is one of the oldest trading houses in Barbados. At the time, Reginald Leon Seale, like other traders, was prohibited from selling rum directly to consumers under Barbados' excise duty law. His solution was to establish a distribution business in Bridgetown in the early 1900s: it is the birth of the R. L. Seale brand. From 1962 to 1993, rums from ESA Field and Alleyne Arthur, including Old Brigand, Taylor's Falernum and Doorly's completed the company's portfolio. In order to effectively consolidate the multiple brands, it was decided that ESA Field and Old Brigand would focus on the local market, where they had always done well, while Doorly would become an export brand. In 1995, under the influence of Sir David Seale, the family bought a sugar factory whose oldest building, dating from 1636, was decrepit. His intuition paid off and this site became Foursquare Distillery. Today the distillery has a three column still which it uses for lighter rums and a modern pot still for more complex rums, which are always distilled from fermented molasses in small batches (usually 112 barrels) and tropically-aged. The rums are aged in small ex-Bourbon American white oak barrels in big open-walled warehouses, most of which come from a distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee.\n\nDétente is a rum aged 10 years in a combination of ex-Bourbon casks and ex-Port casks.",

This bottling is number thirteen in the series. All of the ECS releases named after the year of distillation have been wonderfully straightforward affairs, aged in first, second, and third fill ex-bourbon casks with no additional maturation. This 12 year old rum was bottled in the spring of 2020 at a cask strength of 60% ABV, and as always, without any colorant, added flavor or sweetener of any kind. \n\nThese vintage releases from Foursquare just keep getting \"more\". More intensity of flavor, more wood spice, more fruit, more pot still character shining through, and in this case, a little more ABV as well. That extra proof doesn't express itself with heat though, just a greater depth. Notes of treacle, juicy tart berries, classic Foursquare apple, intense and long lasting wood spice (nutmeg, mace, clove), creamy nougat, coconut, raisin, a slight jolt of wood tannin to balance the fruit and sweetness, and a hint of rummy hogo. It's become almost trite at this point for us to announce that Foursquare has done it again, so we'll leave that for you to declare.",

Aged in both ex-Bourbon casks and brand new oak barrels with a dialed-up ABV of 46%, this is the richest and most vanilla-laden edition of the Real McCoy yet. There's more sweetness, more molasses, more spice, and more weight than the standard 12 year edition despite the younger age statement. And, the rum finishes with a Bourbon-like kick. The blend is comprised of the two wood types, aged separately and then blended together. The ex-Bourbon matured component is all 12 years of age, while the virgin oak-aged rum was matured for the entire decade in new oak. Even though it's labeled as a 10 year-old rum, a large proportion of the rum is 12 years old. This limited edition produced only 3,000 total bottles for the world and we were lucky enough to grab a large chunk of it. Grab a bottle while you can!",

The result is an especially smooth and luscious flavor profile that’s layered with tempered notes of honey and vanilla, and a particularly luxurious, spice-filled finish. Best enjoyed neat or on the rocks, Meikakuna Japanese Whisky pairs expertly with rich, savory foods – something like our new Bacon Wrapped Porchetta, perhaps. It makes an awesome gift to any and all whisky connoisseurs in your life, even—and especially—if that whiskey connoisseur is you.

The distillery produced both malt and grain whiskies which the company blended together, releasing its first Suntory White Label in 1929, the resulting popularity of which saw the firm renamed after it 1963. Expansion in the next decade saw the company move its grain production to a new Chita distillery in 1972, and open a second malt distillery, Hakushu, the following year.

    "description": "Whenever I hear the word Enigma, I can’t help but be reminded of this quote by Demetri Martin. Which in itself is a play on Winston Churchill’s famous quote. But I’m sure neither of those were the inspiration for Cadenhead’s new Enigma series. They initially released two whiskies. One is a 15-year-old Campbeltown Blended Malt, the other a 25-year-old Blended Scotch Whisky.\n\nThe whisky Cadenhead’s bottles in their Enigma series is “unusual, hard to quantify, perhaps even slightly contradictory.” Their own words, not mine. It certainly makes sense for the 25-year-old Blended Scotch, which Cadenhead’s doesn’t have a great deal of information on, except that it matured fully in refill sherry butts. I don’t have much more to add other than my tasting notes below.\n\nCadenhead’s Enigma Blended Malt 15 Years is certainly more quantifiable. It’s a Campbeltown Malt, for one. Most importantly, we know the exact make-up of this whisky. This is a blend of 15-year-old Hazelburn and 16-year-old Kilkerran from ex-bourbon casks. Either of those components on its own would send many whisky drinkers running to shops. Will the sum of these two turn out greater than its parts? One can only hope.",

    "description": "Grant Stand Fast 8 Year Old Scotch Liter Vintage bottle 86 Proof bottle notice the words Glenfiddich and Balvenie on top of the label in small font.William Grant, was born in 1839. When he started working in the distillery business as a bookkeeper in 1866 he could scarce have imagined that his own branded whisky would become a worldwide business. Or that it would still be wholly owned by his family five generations later.We think nothing could have made him more proud. Christmas Day is a wonderful time to begin a storyIt was on Christmas Day in 1887 that William Grants own distillery produced its first golden drops of spirit.It had taken 20 years for William to acquire both the expertise and the funds to get started as an independent distiller. Fortunately, he was determined in life, astute in business and skilled in the art of whisky making.William built his first distillery with the help of his seven sons and two daughters. And it was his son-in-law Charles Gordon who became the companys first salesman. A role that took a great deal of determination.Charles started simply by knocking on doors, laden with samples of Williams carefully crafted whisky.At the 181st call he secured his first sale. After a further 503 he landed the second. From then on, things became easier.Williams son, John, then introduced Grants whisky to the wider world by exporting it to the Hudson Bay Company of Canada. With this, Grants worldwide adventure had begun.In 1909 Charles Gordon, spent a year taking Grants to Australia and the Far East. At the start of his epic 12-month journey, Charles wrote in his notebook:All things must yield to industry and time. None cease to rise but those who cease to climb.Sales moved quickly and by 1914, Grants fame had spread and the company had over 60 representatives in 30 countries.In 1915, a new law stated that the minimum maturation period for Scotch whisky was to be two years (today it is three). While this led to the ruin of many a Scotch whisky distillery, William Grant had kept a supply of aging whisky in stock and was able to ensure the UK had sufficient Grants to be enjoyed throughout the war years.After the Great War, prohibition took effect in many countries, but as a family business, Grant's had the freedom and the foresight to increase production on the belief that prohibition would not last. And when it did end, we had stocks ready to meet the public demand.The end of an era William Grant died in 1923. His real legacy is the unique enthusiasm and energy to succeed that has remained at the heart of the family and the way Grants is made today.The passion for quality continues In 1963, during construction of the Girvan grain distillery, Williams great-grandson, Charles Gordon became so involved in the build that he frequently lived on site in a caravan. He became known for cycling around the site, personally checking each and every minute detail. When the distillery was finally completed, his bicycle was fixed to one of Girvans grain towers as a memento.Then, in 1979, a milestone “ Grants UK sales surpass 1 million cases.Today, Grants sells over 54 million bottles each year in over 180 countries, making us one of the worlds most enjoyed whiskies. Throughout this time, the care and craftsmanship behind Grants whisky remain unchanged. Just as William would have wanted.",

    "description": "If you've ever been to the Highlander Inn, you'll know all too well that it's dangerously close to two of Scotland's best distilleries. One has become so ubiquitous that its name does not even connote Scotch any longer, but simply luxury. The other is the rugged and rustic dark horse (formerly owned by White Horse!) Craigellachie. They're putting out some of the very best malt anywhere in Scotland to little fanfare. The still house has been reconstructed in the modern era and looks similar to Glendronach's, a stone and glass box, which isn't so pretty from the outside, but gives the distiller plenty of air and space to work. It wasn't until recently that owners Bacardi began marketing this excellent malt on its own, although the vast majority of this whisky still ends up in the Dewars blend. Built in 1891 on the cliffs across from Macallan, if you miss the turn off to Dufftown, you'll miss Craigellachie, but the next road takes you right to the Highlander Inn. There you should stop and taste the local dram of choice. Or save a trip and try this awesome little cask. Aged for 14 years in a refill sherry butt, the malt has all the classic hallmarks of this awesome distillery. Dense and chewy, without being masked by the fresh sherry, the malt offers plenty of deep herbal character, powerful savory spice and complex cacao flavors. This malt was teaspooned with a small quantity of Dailuaine to declassify it. Be sure to add some water to soften this rugged whisky a bit.",

As they grew and became more successful in the 1880s, they acquired whisky distilleries in Scotland, such as Glen Spey and Strathmill, as well as gin distilleries in Canada and Australia.",

    "description": "Syndicate 58/6 Premium Blended Scotch Whisky contains 18 single malt whiskies and 4 single grain whiskies, and is aged through a solera system. Solera aging involves filling a series of casks at different intervals over a long period of time. As whiskey from the oldest cask is emptied and bottled, the cask is re-filled with an equivalent amount of whiskey from the second-oldest cask in the solera. This cascading effect continues until the youngest cask in the solera is filled with new whiskey. As a result, no cask in the solera is ever fully emptied. In addition, as the younger whiskey ages and cascades through the solera, its average age and complexity gradually increases over time.\n\nBecause of the solera aging process, Syndicate 58/6 still contains a small amount of the original blend discovered in 19858. Finally, Syndicate 58/6 Premium Blended Scotch Whisky is “married” and additionally matured for up to two years in Oloroso Sherry casks imported from the Andalucia region of Spain.\n\nAs a result, Syndicate 58/6 Premium Blended Scotch Whisky has an burley aroma of roasted grains, cinnamon, oatmeal, orange peel and light smoke. The body is full of complexity, with notes of honey, apple pie, sherry and butterscotch, and leads to a hearty finish complete with smoked meats, pepper and tanned leather.",

    "description": "When we went on a road trip through America, we realized that a great Bourbon must be truly American - a union of diverse wild Spirits that come together for something greater than their sum.\n\nSo, after three years of building the most American Bourbon, we’re proud to present Corn Trooper, a glorious blend of seven Straight Bourbons from seven states. Colorado, Texas, Kentucky, Michigan, New York, South Carolina, and Washington are the terroirs that gave the unique characters that went into this craft marriage. The harmony of Bourbons has a powerful nose and a spicy personality with notes of maple syrup, Oak, Cinnamon, Vanilla, Dark Cherry, Orange Peel, and Apple Peels.\n\nThere are no words to describe how proud we are of this release. We hope Corn Trooper becomes your next favorite Bourbon.",

As a craft distiller, we have the perfect opportunity to innovate, so we set out to create an American blended whiskey that would rival the best Scottish, Irish and Canadian blends. We spent over two years sampling an enormous number of whiskeys, determining the characteristics of our favorites, and then experimenting with different combinations to capture an even better, more robust flavor. We finally settled on the perfect recipe: An extraordinarily complex spectrum of fragrance and flavor that mixes well or stands alone on the rocks or neat.

So a few years ago he and a couple partners begin building a distillery-barn in the Sonoma hills. They are currently bottling two whiskies, a bourbon and a rye. Both are made from a blend of grain spirits sourced in Indiana, Tennessee and of course California. They are aged for at least 2 years in white oak barrels on site in Healdsburg.\n\nThe plan is to eventually use only locally sourced grains and distill and age everything in their own barn. In the meantime the current releases allow whiskey enthusiasts to taste Matt's approach, which is heavily influenced by his wine background. He emphasizes a balance of spice, herbs and sweetness with a judicious amount of oak spice. And unlike many craft whiskies, Lost Republic is priced for everyday consumption. We highly encourage you get on board early with this exciting project",

    "description": "Founded more than a decade ago by California surfer Rodney “Rod” Cegelski, and Aussie Hamish “Hammer” Marshall, Rod & Hammer's Slo Stills crafts American spirits. The story of Slo Stills began in 1988 at the Slo Brew brewery. In 2012 they distilled and aged their first whiskey, a rye beer mash made in the original Garden street copper kettle. They realize that the most important ingredient and the crucial part of distilling is time ― hence the name. Their other not-so-secret ingredient is purified oceanic water, as every spirit of theirs is cut with Pacific Ocean water. \"California meets Australia,\" as they say.\n\nDried & malted grains are milled, exposing the starches within. Then they add water, cooking the mash in order to convert those starches to sugars. Yeast is then added to the wort in fermenting tanks, starting the fermentation process that converts the sugars to alcohol, and turns the wort into beer. This beer is then distilled. The resultant spirit is then transferred to charred new American Oak barrels, where it matures from 6 months to 2 years or more. Before bottling the spirit is filtered and brought to proof with purified oceanic water.\n\nThe Rod & Hammer Slo Stills Cask Bourbon Whiskey is an uncut and non-chill filtered bourbon that's bottled straight from the barrel at 112 proof. It's crafted with a mash bill of 55% corn, 35% rye, and 10% malted barley. The expression spends 2 years in new American white oak barrels, resulting in a bold whiskey with gentle smoke, oak, vanilla, and caramel notes, with just the right amount of sweetness and warmth.",

Historically the facility, as bourbon writer Chuck Cowdery pointed out in 2016, is “a revival of the old Medley Distillery, home of Ezra Brooks and other bourbons, which United Distillers (now Diageo) acquired in 1991 and closed in 1992.” In modern times it is owned by Terressentia, best known for its patented TerrePURE process that’s designed to rapidly age spirits such as whiskey. The company acquired the property in 2014 after it lay dormant for many years, fixing it up, opening it to the pubic and laying down whiskey the old school way, albeit it with a bit of a 21st century touch in the mix.\n\nToday, word is O.Z. Tyler is releasing the first fruits of its aging labor. The new O.Z. Tyler Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey, according to those behind it, is a blend consisting of 70 percent locally sourced corn, 21 percent rye, and 9 percent malted barley. It was aged in #4 char oak barrels for a year and a day, in a nod to tradition, and then fast filtered for eight hours with the TerrePURE process to reportedly leave “a smooth liquid with a great mouth-feel that tastes comparable to other fine bourbons.”",

He then cooks the mash of corn and oats thoroughly, before letting it cool down to proper temperature for adding the barley and finally cool down enough for yeast to be added. My job is usually to pitch the yeast and make sure its happy. Happy yeast makes for a good fermentation. Wade checks the fermentation every day until it is ready to distill. \n\nOur mash bill is unique, it is 80% corn, 10% oats and 10% barley.

From a base of Blue Corn grown in California and White Corn grown in the Midwest, to the Alpine Water, Lost Sierra Bourbon and Tributary Bourbon embody that spirit. While we can’t compete on volume with the monolithic distilleries in Kentucky, our handcrafted bourbons are a product of the purest alpine waters, hand selected ingredients, and a passion for the art and science of distillation. \n\nOne of the greatest aspects of our country is diversity of climate, and here in the American West, we have daily temperature swings and a climate unlike anywhere in the US. These temperature swings swell and contract the American Oak barrels in our warehouses, which pulls and pushes the spirit in and out of the wood in a manner not found elsewhere. The dry climate aids in pulling more spirit into the wood, and these fluctuations ultimately create a spirit that is as unique as it is bold.\n\nNot all Bourbon is made in Kentucky, but all Bourbon is American.",

It sits at the top of the Canadian Club lineup and, unlike the standard six-year bottle, is definitely made for sipping.\n\nOn the nose, the Sherry Cask is fairly subtle, with hints of caramel and maple underneath the alcohol.  The taste is more robust, bursting with lots of sweet caramel, nuttiness and peppery spice.  There’s much less fruitiness than I was expecting the sherry casks to impart into the whiskey.  It finishes long and warm, with that grippy spice outlasting the sweetness.  Despite the spice, it’s still fairly soft on the palate and doesn’t require any water or ice to mellow the flavors.\n\nOverall, Canadian Club Sherry Cask has a lot going on.  The sweet caramel and peppery spice flavors don’t always play nice, but keep sipping and it all eventually comes together.  It’s a nice effort by Canadian Club and certainly worth a try.",

    "description": "This single-cask Canadian whisky was made from a 50/50 mash of peated malt and malted wheat, matured 8 years in a First Fill ex-Bourbon cask. The first 'Excelsior' release from the Maligne Range is a collaboration with Kensington Wine Market, bottled at 48%. \n\n7 years ago Andrew made this whisky with Bryce Parsons at Last Best Brewing in Calgary. The whisky was filled into an ex-Bourbon Barrel, which had previously matured a Jefferson's Reserve Bourbon KWM exclusive bottling. When they made the whisky, they had no idea when, or under what brand it would be bottled. \n\nWay back in October of 2016, Kensington Wine Market had a once used Jefferson's Reserve Bourbon Barrel, from one of our store-exclusive bottlings. It had a lot of life left in it, so we set about finding something to do with it. Working with Bryce from Last Best Brewing & Distilling, it was decided we should fill the cask with spirit. A little more than 8 years later, that whisky is spirit.  \"The Maligne Range is an independent Canadian malt whisky-maker and blender. We distill small batch whiskies that are the vital essence of our expressions. These highly-flavoured whiskies from unique grain bills are the character actors on our whisky stage. We allow them to age in oak casks for a minimum of 5 years, affected by the capricious Alberta climate. We then blend with an ensemble cast of blending whiskies – some we distill, others are collaborations with renowned Canadian distilleries. The result is a range of Canadian whiskies that blaze new trails into the remote Western Canadian wilderness of possibility.\n\n\"The Maligne Range is the result of decades of experience brewing some of Western Canada’s best craft beers. The people who created Jasper Brewing, Banff Ave Brewing, Last Best Brewing & Distilling, and Campio Brewing have built on their experience and passion for craft spirits with this uniquely Canadian whisky brand. Like those breweries, The Maligne Range aspires to become a community cornerstone through the celebration of the craft of making Canadian whisky.\n\n\"In late-spring 2024 we will be inviting visitors to our new home in Jasper. The Maligne Range experience centre will be a celebration of Canadian whisky and elevated dining with a unique Jasper twist. Set against the spectacular backdrop of the Athabasca Valley, our guests will discover the full Maligne Range of products including house exclusives, curated cocktails and gastronomy that complete the experience.",

    "description": "Beyond the Tekarra whisky that we are previewing today, other planned Western Canadian Whisky releases in the works will be named after the mountains in the Maligne Range as well. These include limited special editions or casks under the Excelsior series – with the first release planned being a Kensington Wine Market cask that was filled back in 2016. Core expressions beyond this are also in the works.\n\nTo promote the Tekarra and future Malgine Range bottles, a whisky Experience Centre will be launched in Jasper in the spring of 2024. It was started by the founders of Last Best Brewing and Distilling, which is located in Calgary, Alberta. Master Distiller Bryce Parsons leads the whisky program.\n\nThe distillery at Last Best is small, but mighty, and has been used for quite a bit of spirit experimentation since its inception by Bryce Parsons and his cohorts. Bryce spent a year creating and releasing a different small batch gin every week back in 2018. Before then, and since, whisky distillation and creation have also been a major goal. Bryce also created a whisky called The Beast, which was a whisky distilled using malt that was exposed to smoke in the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire. One bottle of The Beast sold for $10,000 Canadian at auction, and all proceeds from the limited release of 50 bottles were donated to Fort McMurray Firefighters Charities Association, which distributes money to other local organizations.\n\nBack to the Tekarra. The whisky we are tasting today is a preview, with the full bottle release planned for mid-January 2024. It is made up of two components.\n\nThe first component whisky was distilled at Last Best from malted barley, then matured in a combination of ex-Bourbon barrels and New American Oak barrels with a level 3 Char made at The Barrel Mill Cooperage of Avon, Minnesota.\n\nThe second component is a little bit different. It was a distillation of what was essentially an Imperial Porter recipe without the hops. It included four different types of malted barley: two crystal malts, one chocolate malt, and a brewer’s malt, PLUS roasted wheat and Demerara sugar. The Demerara sugar would be considered a flavouring component under the Canadian Whisky 1/11 or 9.09% rule. This flavouring component was mashed, fermented, distilled, and aged together with the first component.\n\nThe result is the whisky in front of us, bottled at 48% ABV.",

    "description": "The initial 21 year old release as part of the Northern Border Collection in 2017 featured additional aging in Speyside scotch whisky barrels. I never picked up the 2018 release that was aged in Hungarian oak (as that kind of finishing isn’t something I typically enjoy). But last year, they released a version that used Oloroso sherry casks for aging – which is much more likely to be up my alley. I typically enjoy single malt scotch whiskies aged in sherry casks (Oloroso in particular – with their classic nutty, dried dark fruits, rancio and tannic oak notes). Sherry oak casks are not something you come across too often in Canadian whisky, so this was certainly worth a gamble.\n\nLike most Pike Creek’s, this is made predominantly from the light base, column-distilled corn whisky that underpins most Canadian whisky, aged for 21 years. Added to this base is a touch of column-distilled rye whisky, for extra peppery spice. The blend was then finished (or re-gauged, in Canadian whisky parlance) in Oloroso sherry casks for an undisclosed period of time.\n\nBottled at 45% ABV. This edition retails for $90 CAD at the LCBO in Ontario. I picked up my bottled on sale in Alberta for a bit less late last Fall. Only 4481 bottles were produced, but it can still be found in some jurisdictions (including Ontario).\n\nOf note, this whisky won Whisky of the Year at the Canadian Whisky Awards in early 2020. This competition involves blind taste testing by an experienced panel of Canadian whisky reviewers, and is always worth a close look every year. You can learn more about these awards in my Canadian Whisky Trends for 2020 article.",

    "description": "Rhum Clement is one of Martinique's oldest and most respected distilleries. The Habitations Clement was founded in 1887, but didn't begin producing rhum in earnest until the French Alcohol shortages during World War I. The Agricole style of rum arose from several factors namely the creation by Napoleon of the sugar beet industry, which decimated sugar prices. This left sugar growers in French Territories with any extreme excess of raw sugar and very little incentive to process it. The easiest way to recoup the investment was to fresh press the cane and distill immediately rather than spend energy refining the sugar. It wasn't until the French began taxing rum imports that Agricole Rhum truly began to flourish. It became the only affordable Caribbean rhum on the continent and has become ingrained in the French drinking culture. In a lot of ways Agricole Rhum can be compared to Armagnac. They are both distilled on traditional alembic column stills, rather than the industrial columns of the Spanish style or the funk pot stills of the British. Because of the inherent instability of raw cane fermentation tends to be quite high ester, resulting in extremely funky flavorful white rhums. As these rhums age those esters interact with the complex chemicals naturally present in oak to create some of the most complex and unique spirits available anywhere in the world. This special cask was distilled from 7 varieties of cane and aged in New American Oak and bottled at cask strength.",

The distillation still rests on the historical copper Savalle column of 1938, at 73 °, low alcohol content to obtain a spirit of great structure. The 52.5 ° version of white agricultural rhum is an innovative label that has been very successful. It is produced by the only canne bleue variety grown in the parcel of Thieubert, near the ocean.

The distillery grows all its own cane, on the volcanic slopes of Mount Pelée (probably the only distillery in the world built on a volcano!). Whilst this might sound perilous, the volcanic soil provides a perfectly fertile environment for growing cane. This cane is then pressed and the juice fermented, as is the way with Rhum Agricole. This creates a more fragrant and grassier style than rum produced with molasses or Demerara. This rum has been distilled in column stills, before a three year maturation in re-charred Bourbon barrels and a finishing period of a year in lightly toasted American virgin oak casks. On the nose aromas of thick fudge, meringue, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove greet the drinker. The palate brings a wonderful buttery palate, with some citrus rind, fudge and salted caramel, with a little grassy cane juice. The finish is soft, yet linger with tropical fruit notes of overripe bananas. Bottled at 43% ABV, this gives the flavours a little extra kick. Another classic bottling from Rhum J.M.",

    "description": "In the past, a ship's captain would take a ladle of rum, add gunpowder and ignite it to provide \"proof\" of the rum's integrity to his crew. Sailor Jerry continues this age-old tradition of serving quality spiced rum to provide an unmatched base for mixed drinks. \n\nThe brand prides itself on creating spiced rum the old-school way, using an expert blend of carefully chosen spices in high-proof rum for a perfectly balanced liquid. Because sailors refused to water down their spirits, this 92-proof spiced rum definitely offers a historically accurate experience.\n\nCrafted after intensive research into historical maritime rums, Sailor Jerry developed a smooth rum with a rich flavor. The result is a high-proof spirit that's perfect for mixing in your favorite cocktails, including Long Island Iced Teas, Mai Tais and Mojitos. The rum features prominent oak and vanilla flavors with hints of cinnamon and clove spices.",

Producing consistently concentrated cold brew and fine-tuning water composition, temperature and time are lifelong obsessions for both the distillery's head of coffee, Detlef Mohr, and Master Distiller, Philip Moore. The concentrated flavors of the bittersweet cold brew are melded with the soft sweetness of Australian wheat vodka to create a drink of balance and power. A hint of cane sugar is added to add depth and open the dark rich flavors of the Arabica beans.

Legend has it that a Goddess came to Cihuatán many centuries ago, and bestowed its lands with riches and fertility. She then went to sleep on the valley to always look after its crops. Her spirit still watches over our sugarcane fields, remaining in the shape of the Guazapa Mountain.

    "description": "This zesty and mouthwatering vodka is made from real California-grown Valencia oranges, Seville oranges, and bergamot. The result is a spirit thats beautifully aromatic and full of fresh citrus flavor. THE PROCESS We start by sourcing the best citrus fruit we can find: Valencia oranges, Seville oranges, and bergamot from Lindcove Ranch, a family farm in Californias San Joaquin Valley. Weve sourced fruit from farmer John Kirkpatrick and his family for the last 12 years. When we receive fresh citrus fruit from Lindcove Ranch, we infuse the Valencia orange, Seville orange, and bergamot peels separately into a non-GMO base spirit. We then distill each infusion separately, blend all three distillates together, then filter the resulting vodka to remove visible impurities before bottling. THE EXPERIENCE Astonishingly clear citrus flavor, genuinely tasting of both sour and sweet orange. Redolent of the whole citrus plant, with focus on the bright peel characteristics. Tart almost lemony scent in the nose. Simple perfection over ice, with soda, or in your own original creation! Find a few recipes ideas here. WHAT THEYRE SAYING The scent has all the finesse of a fine perfume. Evokes the memory of orange groves and noses pressed against citrus warmed by the sun. You could sip this one straight.

Every bottle of Gray Whale Gin supports Oceana, protecting and restoring the world's oceans, so that Gray Whales will continue to make that epic journey for another 30 million years.\n\nOur carefully selected botanicals are sourced from sustainable organic farms, or wild foraged. First, all our sun-dried botanicals are weighed, inspected and poured directly into the pot still. Then the fresh hand-zested citrus and fir-tree needles are placed into a vapor extraction bag.

We mill the grains, we ferment the mash and we distill the botanicals. We focus on every detailed step to prepare this gin the right way. We even use our own rye whiskey as the base for this gin. Our Still Austin Gin touches two types of stills: our column still to craft the cleanest rye spirit base, and our copper-pot still to make sure the aromatics blend seamlessly. The result is a perfectly balanced gin, distilled in small batches with real botanicals and proofed down slowly over time, as a part of the élevage philosophy.",

With a silky texture and a slight lingering sweetness, its proprietary distillate allows our head distiller to compose a gin with structure, a longer finish, and greater definition of component flavors. It is a gin in the classic style, while welcoming some novel flavors to the mix.\n\nPink peppercorn (native to Southern California) and pistachio compliment quintessential gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander, cinnamon, and angelica. To achieve a warmth and balance, two varieties of juniper are used: both juniperus communis and its earthier, local cousin, juniperus californica.\nThe nose is balsalmy, full, and juniper-forward. Spicy notes of pink peppercorn carry across the tongue, yielding to a bright citrus finish.",

This remains the traditional naval rum recipe, a blend of five different Caribbean rums, based around a core of Guyanese Demerara rum. The name is a throwback to when spirit strengths were tested (or “proofed”) by soaking a pellet of gunpowder in them. If the gunpowder still ignited, then the spirits were considered “overproof”, and taxed at a higher rate. As such, this rum weighs in at a powerful 54.5% ABV, enriching further the classic dark, sweet notes of crumbling sugar and treacle. An icon of the rum world, this bottling picked up a Trophy award at the 2016 International Spirits Challenge.",

With its experience in cognac, the distillery uses the double distillation method to develop its agricultural rums. The production is artisanal for decades until the development of Jean Gardère in the 1940s who considerably developed the business. It is located in the heart of the island in the middle of the cane fields in the Cul-de-sac plain. Barbancourt has always belonged to the same family since its creation. It is the most famous of Haiti and it is recognized internationally through numerous awards each year.\n\nHere we offer you the famous cuvée Réserve from the estate, 15 years old. Originally this cuvée was reserved for family and friends of the distillery. The quantities are limited but the reputation of this cuvée has convinced the owners to take this cuvée out to amateurs all over the world, but again too sparingly. Double distillation, pure cane juice and 15 years of aging in oak barrels have made this rum a sure value. A roasted rum (coffee and cocoa) on the nose, in the mouth it is sweet with notes of nuts, citrus. A nice length for an incredible rum. To be enjoyed at the end of the evening with a good friend!",

Exactly what these selectively chosen casks profiles are isn’t abundantly clear, but this Classic offering is presumable unpeated and aged in ex-bourbon barrels, in the “classic” style of single malt.\n\nThe nose is a unique combination of bright orchard fruits, cereal sweetness, and a bit of salty brine. The sweetness wins out for the most part with the orchard fruits becoming spiced and stewed as things open up. The palate is silky and rich, initially dominated by notes of fresh, arboreal honey, with and without the waxy comb. A subtle clove-studded-orange note arrives on the mid-palate, complemented by ground cinnamon and a touch of herbal tea. Even at cask strength, the heat isn’t overpowering and builds gently with a final pop of spice on a generous honey-sweet finish that shows fading notes of sweet grain and drying oak. I wouldn’t necessarily call this a “classic” whisky, but it’s certainly a good one.",

    "description": "The Blue Spot 7 Years Old Cask Strength Whiskey is the fourth and last release in the famous Mitchell & Son ‘Spot Series’. Next to the Yellow, Red, and Green Spot, you can now enjoy this 58.7% whopper of an Irish Whiskey. With the release of this bourbon barrel, sherry butt and madeira cask aged whiskey, Mitchell & Son complete the revival of a 50-year-old and nearly forgotten series. The last time a Blue Spot whiskey was bottled goes back to 1964. No man had even set foot on the moon back then. The colors refer to the way whiskey casks were marked back in the day. The Blue Spot 7 Years Old Cask Strength Whiskey was only released in Ireland, the UK, France and Canada.",

    "description": "This limited-edition expression pays tribute to the colourful history of the Mitchell’s whiskey bonding business which commenced in 1887 when the bonders sent empty wine and fortified wine casks to the local Jameson Distillery, in Bow Street, to be filled with new single pot still spirit for maturation in its underground cellars. Once filled, the fortified wine casks would be marked with a daub or ‘spot’ of coloured paint, to determine the age potential with Blue Spot, Green Spot, Yellow Spot and Red Spot, respectively indicating the 7, 10, 12 and 15 years of the celebrated expression within the Spot range.\n\nThe colour gold symbolises quality, prestige, specialness and celebration and so the Mitchells chose this colour to signify their enduring relationship with whiskey bonding over seven generations and 135 years.  This special release commemorates the past and nods to the future of whiskey innovation by embodying the unmistakable qualities of single pot still Irish whiskey.\n\nMatured for a minimum of nine years, the expression builds on the foundation of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks, typical of the Spot whiskey style, and is married together with a unique proportion of hand selected Bordeaux wine casks and port pipes. The inclusion of port casks – sourced from Irish Distillers’ long-established partners in Portugal’s Douro Valley– is a first for a modern iteration of Spot whiskey.\n\nWorking in collaboration with the Mitchells, the team at Midleton Distillery was inspired by archive documents dating back to the late 1800s showing significant quantities of port casks imported into Ireland which, once emptied, would have been used to mature whiskey. The combination of the four different cask types imparts exceptional flavours of vibrant fruits enhanced by delicate oak tannins and wood spices, with the port wine-driven cask inclusion adding an additional layer of complexity and character, alongside a taste of history.",

Unique among whiskeys, Redbreast small batch is a single pot still Irish whiskey blended exclusively of pot still whiskeys which have been triple distilled and then matured, for no less than 14 years, in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks. This release is a unique project spearheaded by Billy Leighton, Master Blender at Midleton. Four batches were blended together from 22-27 barrels each. Each batch was blended to highlight the unique, rich character of Redbreast, and showcase a different wood profile. Batch B comes in at 57.2% ABV and was started out in bourbon barrels before being recasked in to Oloroso sherry. While batch B wasn't the heaviest sherried batch, it was certainly the most well balanced, clearly showing both intense dried fruits, but also the pretty pot distillate. That balance is a prized trait for any Irish whiskey, and specifically why we selected it for K&L. 252 bottles produced.",

They're famous for a diverse offering of Shochus and high quality liqueurs, but a tiny portion of their production is devoted to malted rice distillation. In Japan, these old whiskies are not bottled as such, though they do meet the definition by American standards. Instead they use them to make their high-end liqueurs, which is sad for them, but GREAT for us. This rare spirit is aged much like bourbon in new charred oak casks. The result is something absolutely sublime and uniquely Japanese. While one might be expecting Shochu squared, we're in fact in a totally different arena altogether. Nothing like you might have had from other producers bringing in similarly labeled product. Somewhere between scotch, bourbon and \"other whisky\", both the complexity of aromatics and texture on the palate are surprising. This cask has a vibrant nose of nut brittle, spiced fruit, lemon rind, and almond butter. A very subtle oceany quality persists in the back ground. Supremely drinkable but not without a pop on the backend, this is a true bridge between Single Malt and Bourbon. We have no doubt that everyone is going to love drinking this, although its limited nature makes it a strong candidate for most regrettable failure to click of the year. It's our first single cask Japanese whisky since the famous Karuizawas of 2013, don't expect it to last much longer than those did.",

In the same year he created his first whiskey here - \"Nicca\". Later, Masataka opened another plant - \"Miyyagikio\" in the north of the archipelago. In addition, the company \"Nikka\" owns Scottish distillery Ben Nevis and the factory Dompierre in the Cognac region.\n\nToday, \"Nikka\" ranked second in Japan for the production of whiskey.

There’s Yamazaki in there too, of course.\n\nTasting Notes,\n\nNose: Dried fruits, specifically prunes, dates, apricot, and berries. Lots more sherry going on here than with Royal. There’s a hint of orange as well. Thicc and aromatic, it’s actually quite nice. There’s Yamazaki here too.\n\nPalate: Orange sticks around and is joined by white pepper and some bitter chocolate. Sugary and oaky too, with excellent overall balance. Light and easy sipping.\n\nFinish: Medium-length, lasting fruits, and a bit of oak bitterness.",

    "description": "Contrary to (and in fact the exact opposite of) what certain ill-informed websites will tell you, light whiskey is not distilled to a lower proof than regular whiskey. In fact, it is whiskey (made of unspecified grain) that is distilled to a higher proof — generally 80 to 95 percent alcohol. That puts it somewhere between “real” whiskey and neutral spirits like vodka, which are distilled to 95% alcohol or higher. Typically light whiskey is used like grain whiskey is for blending, and it finds a home in various whiskey products, including Canadian whiskey. Rarely do you find it released on its own.\n\nFor this limited release, High West sourced 100 barrels of light whiskey from Indiana’s MGP, distilled from corn between 1999 and 2001, which spent 14 years in second-fill barrels, and it’s releasing it all uncut and unblended.\n\nThe nose is slight, with notes of caramel corn, butterscotch, and some astringency. The body is surprisingly sweet — corn syrup, caramelized banana, and whipped cream. Very light on the tongue — the moniker of “light whiskey” isn’t a bad one — it gets to the finish quite quickly, which is fairly clean, quiet, and uncomplicated, but which offers notes of tobacco and gentle grains.",

It was then taken to Germany and Russia the latter is now the principal producer and consumer of k¼mmel.The Berlin-made Gilka K¼mmel goes through a longer distillation process and has a smoother taste than the Russian k¼mmels, and it has become the accepted standard of k¼mmel quality for the past century.In the UK, it is a popular drink at many of the more traditional golf clubs.",

Harvest between 2500-3800 feet above sea-level exclusively from the Java varietal of estate grown sugar cane. The cane is crush and the fresh juice put into pine vats for up to ten days of fermentation without any additions of yeast or other chemicals. When the natural fermentation is complete Rommel Krassel distilled the batch on his small 250-liter custom built pot still. It was filled into new French oak casks and aged in their driest warehouse for just shy of 1 and a half years before being transferred into open-topped demi-john for an additional 6 months of resting. Finishing in glass allows for an oxygenation period which adds body and complexity resulting in a 14% angel's share. It was bottled at full strength of 130.8 proof without additions of any kind in October of 2023. The powerful aromas of tropical spices, dense fruit, fresh leather, exotic wood, and sweet fruit compote are briming from the glass. The high proof not immediately obvious on the palate hiding behind deep flavors of cinnamon, clove, black tea, wild honey, and dried tobacco. A totally unprecedented experience that can only be understood after opening a bottle of this unparalleled elixir.

Its truly distinctive sweet and bitter taste is acquired by combining rums of different aging profiles and adding a touch of raisin wine. This blend results in a wide range of delicious aromas and flavors. \n\nDuring the 18th century, the Spanish ships reached America with sweet wine reserves in barrels. Instead of going back with empty barrels, they filled them with Chinguirito, known as Mexican rum. During the trip, the rum absorbed the aromatic characteristics of the barrels, which resulted in a high quality product. \n\nProhibited during the reign of the King of Spain Felipe V De Borbon, for the disastrous effects caused on society by its excessive drinking, this alcohol beverage known as Chinguirito or Habanero comes back to light in its original recipe for the lucky fans of the real rum. \n\nThe Ron Prohibido process starts with sugar cane juice fermentation. The fermented juice, or sugar cane wine, is distilled in a column still to produce rum. The rum is then blended with the solera 15 years to obtain its delicious aroma and flavor.\n\nForbidden for years…never forgotten",

    "description": "A slightly smoky, yet herbaceous undertone rests on the center of the palate, while citrus and floral notes from the Barril are introduced and strengthened by the warm viscose finish of the Mexicano. This is a light and easy sipping mezcal, which will delight and surprise you with its complex lingering finish. The Espadín agave, known as the genetic Mother of the Blue Weber Agave, is used to produce tequila, and is also the predominant agave used in mezcal production. Unique in itself, the characteristics of this agave showcase the aromas of wet earth, a rich smokiness on the mid-palate, and a finish reminiscent of wildflowers. Barril, this thick-foliaged, wild agave, often used as fencing to divide land in Oaxaca, intensifies the complexity of this mezcal. As citrus and floral notes arise, hints of green peppers compliment the nose. The palate is a delightful balance of citrus and creamy banana. Mexicano, The Mexicano agave thrives in the moist environment of lower elevations. This wild agave can grow quite large and is usually harvested when close to ten years of age. The concentration of sugar in the fully mature agave produces an extremely powerful mezcal. The palate is distinctively herbaceous and earthy with a long lasting finish in the mouth.",

    "description": "If you grew up in rural Pennsylvania, chances are you’ve consumed your share of rhubarb. Pies, teas, jams…for a few months a year, it seems like it’s everywhere and in everything. The roots of the Keystone State’s rhubarbiness go all the way back to our favorite insanely industrious and pioneering founding father, Ben Franklin. Aside from leading a revolution and discovering electricity, Franklin was an avid agriculturalist and best friend of botanist John Bartram. In fact, Franklin brought the first rhubarb seeds from Europe to America as a gift for Mr. Bartram in 1771. (Bartram’s Garden in Philadelphia is America’s oldest botanical garden. If you haven’t visited, you really should.) Point in fact, rhubarb originally came from China, where it was used as an herbal tonic. In the late 18th century, cane sugar became more affordable, which changed the way rhubarb was enjoyed.\n\nUpon discovering the capacity of sugar to release the wonders of the plant’s intrinsic flavor, rhubarb migrated from a fold tonic to a tasty treat. Legend has it, Bartram was so enthused with rhubarb, he concocted a lovely garden tea showcasing his new botanical prize. We were mulling over this story when we came up with the idea of creating our own Art in the Age garden spirit in Mr. Bartram’s honor. We are proud to offer you RHUBARB Tea! RHUBARB Tea features a botanical bounty of beets, carrots, lemons, petitgrain, cardamom, pure cane sugar, and of course, Bartram’s prize rhubarb. All organically certified and delicious. A confident 80 proof spirit that’s tangy but not too tangy–sweet, but not too sweet. Crisp and refreshing, but with a hint of spice. We guarantee there’s never been anything else like it…at least not since 1771.",

We chose rum barrels that had previously been used to age French cognac. Long story short, our barrels are vintage and very well travelled. We finish our rye for up to 18 months in these Franco Caribbean casks, resulting in a rare and immensely complex, but incredibly drinkable whiskey, even at 100 proof. With only 2,500 9-liter cases at launch, Angel’s Envy Rum Finished Rye is an extremely small batch release, and we sincerely hope you get the opportunity to enjoy a bottle—neat, mixed or in good company.\n\nFirst, notice the crystal clear quality with a rich reddish amber color. You smell citrus, caramel candy, maple sugar, vanilla oak, hazelnut, spice and sherry wood. You’ll taste sweet rum sherry wood and soft oak with a finish that’s both sweet and dry as well as quick and easy.\n\nWhile the Bourbon is finished in Port Wine casks, Lincoln Henderson decided to give the Rye a touch of the islands.\n\n“We considered finishing a spirit in rum casks for some time and ultimately felt that the spiciness of a well-rounded Rye provided the best pairing,” said Lincoln Henderson, Master Distiller, Angel’s Envy.  “We sourced and sampled more than 100 different rums, before unanimously choosing one with extraordinary richness that perfectly marries with our rye whiskey.”",

    "description": "To create this truly unique whisky, we selectively sourced ree malted rye and the finest malted barley from progressive malt houses, paired them with virgin American oak casks air-dried for 36 months and let it all mature in the maritime air of coastal Sidney.\nOur preference for malted rye over the far more commonly used unmalted rye affords this whisky a points of distinction evident upon the very first sip. This layered, aromatic spirit offers notes of spiced custard, ginger, stone fruit and baked apple pie with a fresh herbal finish that lingers on the palate.\n\nArchie Rose Distilling Co. was founded by Will Edwards in March, 2015 in Rosebery, NSW, initially retailing three products (Signature Dry Gin, Original Vodka & White Rye). Although the idea of starting a distillery in Sydney had been in his mind for some time, the strategic planning of launching Archie Rose started after his visit to some of the first established distilleries since the prohibition in New York and Brooklyn in December 2012.",

When I asked why they weren't talking about it's origins, the owners made it very clear that the reason that they weren't disclosing the supplier is that they're affraid to loose the tiny amount of rye they're getting from this distiller to someone else. Apparently, this isn't the same old Canadian Straight Rye! When they say small batch, they really mean it. These guys are securing a handful of barrels at a time. This batch was only 960 bottles. The Whisky is a blend of 5-year-old Rye Whiskey and 8 to 9-year-old corn whisky from Alberta. Bottled at a seemless 90 proof it will definitely be getting some love from Canadian, Kentucky, and San Fran fans alike.",

This skews more toward bourbon than the Indiana ryes, and that’s a good thing",

It’s a double-gold medal winning, straight Rye Whiskey with enough flavor to knock your boots off. All that flavor comes from its high-rye mash bill — a full 90% rye grain — and the fact that it is bottled at 59.25% ABV without chill filtration. If you’re keeping score, that means it’s a cask strength bottle of liquid manliness. Taken neat, the rye spice comes at you in blast with just a touch of char. With a splash of water, the sweetness reveals itself. In a classic Whiskey cocktail, it shines like a star.",

    "description": "John Drew Collection “Rye Whiskey” was distilled in Alberta, Canada, then aged in Oak Barrels for 4 years before being shipped to Florida and held for Jonathan Drew for an additional three years. The birth of the JOHN DREW COLLECTION began almost twenty years earlier when a young Jonathan Drew ventured from Brooklyn, New York to a remote valley in Nicaragua to open a boutique “hand-made” cigar factory, which he would soon call his home. JD didn’t just move to Nicaragua, he actually lived inside the factory for 15 years. Now, that’s hard core …! It was during those formidable years, deep in the northern mountains of Nicaragua where JD cut his teeth at craft production, making the hand made premium cigars that truly changed the industry. Best known for “Market Disruption” before the word was an art form. JD was the ORIGINAL DISRUPTER. The irreverent… the radiant … the straight out maverick who wrote the book, religion bent to “Destroy & Rebuild” everything in his path. And that’s real talk. Ask your neighbor. Awarded with pioneering new market segments in the premium cigar industry with brands such as ACID Cigars, Liga Privada, and Kentucky Fire Cured, his dream was to venture deeper into his artisan core and push the limits in craft spirits, beer, and even food. And so the story of JOHN DREW begins… a journey filled with pain and joy, all things craft, and an army of random folk who became his family throughout the years. JOHN DREW RYE is smooth and balanced, with robust layers of rich caramel, vanilla and spice.",

Bounded by an abundance of natural resources wonderfully suited to whisky making, the distillery lies in the shadow of nearby Knock Hill - home to springs of pure, clear water - and sits on the doorstep of a region rich in barley and peat.\n\nA natural resource, peat was historically embraced as fuel to fire the still and dry the barley for the distillation of whisky. It is traditionally cut by hand using several traditional cutting tools.\n\nPeatiness can be controlled by the amount of peat burnt and the humidity of the barley. Peat smoke produces chemicals called phenols and it is by its phenol content that a whisky's 'peatiness' can be measured. This phenol content is expressed as PPM (parts per million) and to ensure consistency, Peatheart uses barley, specified by our Master Blender, malted to 40PPM.\n\nAvailable sizes 70cl & 75cl",

Alba is a double entendre referring to both Quercus Alba - the scientific name for American oak, and a term for Scotland itself, roughly translated as \"The Scottish Original.\" As the name implies, this expression of A'Bunadh is aged in American oak giving a distinctly different feel from its heavily sherried brethren. While the spirit itself is responsible for many of the sweet and fruity notes familiar in the sherried expressions, the body and color of this dram is wildly different and more vanilla and cereal notes are highlighted by the American oak. \"The yin to Aberlour A’bunadh’s yang, this cask-strength single malt is matured entirely in bourbon casks rather than sherry. The result is a bracingly pure whisky with deceptive simplicity; its flavors are clean and its structure precise, but it’s far from boring. The nose recalls black-and-white cookies, vanilla-frosted yellow cake, and shortbread with caramel topping, along with honeysuckle, jasmine, and coconut cream. Mouth-coating and full, it has flavors of poached pear, malt balls, nougat, lemon curd, toasted coconut, and hints of spice. Vanilla, chocolate, and nut flavors are almost endless on the finish.

    "description": "Clouded by Orcadian mystery, even its origins are unclear, however it’s claimed that Highland Park has been up-and-running since the late eighteenth century, even if going by other names. \n\nOf the two distilleries on the island of Orkney, it’s Highland Park that usually takes the spotlight. Not necessarily because it makes better whisky than its neighbor, Scapa, but certainly because it’s the more ‘muscular’ and memorable of the two.\n\nIts spirit has a dry, smoky backbone, which comes from the use of peat during kilning of its barley, some of which is done at the distillery’s malting floor. Locally sourced peat is also used, lending distinct characteristics to the spirit. More smoky than medicinal, unlike some of its Islay contenders, Highland Park sits rather nicely in the middle of the mild-smoky spectrum, which some find irresistible.\n\nSurrounding Highland Park’s smoky backbone is a distinctly fruity quality. Both bourbon and sherry casks are utilized by the distillery, developing the whisky in vastly different ways, and expressions that are vattings of both cask types are quite common.This rare bottling of cask strength has been matured in ex-bourbon casks. A glowing amber color with a sweet peaty aroma on the nose. To taste, it is bursting with spicy fruits and has a long peaty finish. Add a drop or two of water and sip neat.",

By the end of the 20th century it had become the most highly-priced single malt on a trade basis.\n\nSynonymous with its sister distillery, Brora, which was built adjacent, Clynelish utilises unpeated barley whereas Brora utilises unpeated, low-peated and heavily peated barley.\n\nToday Clynelish enjoys cult status as distinctly unique: a rarity in that it produces a ‘waxy’ new-make spirit – think waxed jacket or waxy honeycomb; Brora previously mothballed is due to be rebuilt by current owners, Diageo. The waxy style of Clynelish is a quirk of build-up of oils (that are wax-like, oddly enough) found within the feints receiver. Interaction with this build-up transforms a spirit that should (on paper) be fruit-forward into one with a distinct waxiness. Not too dissimilar to Deanston Distillery.",

The spirit of Glasgow, you might say.\n\nOne of the last remaining Lowlanders, or at least it was until the region saw recent resurgence. What it does embrace like no other there is the exclusive use of triple distillation.\n\nAuchentoshan is a champion of triple distillation, a relatively unconventional process in Scotland that utilizes an intermediate still, promoting a lighter style through increased copper contact and distillate strength. Typically cereal characteristics lead its style, however its high strength promotes a decidedly clean and delicate spirit, which can take on fruity and floral characteristics.\n\nDistinctly light in profile, and at the opposite end of the spectrum to some of the heavier and textured single malts. What’s amazing is that Auchentoshan, despite having endured years of harshness, consistently creates whisky that is bright, delicate and wise like no other.",

When James Findlater founded Mortlach in 1823, the first distillery in what would eventually become a prolific whisky-producing community, he created a single malt whisky so brutish and audacious in character that no person dare entertain the notion of altering its method of distillation, despite its convolution.\n\nDistillation here is configured in such a way that the No. 1 spirit still – known at the distillery as ‘Wee Witchie’ – is utilized to distill the ‘weak feints’ three times during the same run. The resulting spirit, according to the distillation team, is an aggregated 2.81 times distilled, and drawn diagrammatically is enough to leave you tipsy.\n\nAll of this tradition is upheld in order to promote a very meaty and sulfury spirit, which is so important for Diageo’s blending program, the distillery’s owner. As an extreme example of this style, Mortlach has robust body, which means it can withstand prolonged aging without succumbing to the flavor found in the wood in which it is matured, and if less mature or matured in refill casks, retains vibrant smoked-meat characteristics.",

Oily, robust and entirely unapproachable to many, vintages from Ben Nevis to this day give a reminiscing nod to the past and often coat the palate with a wonderfully curious explosion of earthy tar and fresh citrus. Maturity will tame its fiery soul, usually gifting a basket of fruitiness.\n\nIn times past, particularly the late nineteenth century, it was because of whisky like Ben Nevis that grocers in Scotland blended whiskies together to make a more palatable dram.\n\nNot for the faint hearted!

Perhaps ‘twins’ is inaccurate, as Glenlossie is the original distillery built in 1876; Mannochmore was later added, in 1971.\n\nGlenlossie is responsible for a style of single malt that is almost unique amongst distilleries – best known for its subtle oily character, which results from bulbous stills that incorporate purifiers, a scarcely adopted technique in the Scotch whisky industry. This profile can become almost cream-like during maturation, whilst retaining bursts of grassiness and intense candied fruit.\n\nGlenlossie’s significant difference in style to adjacent Mannochmore (fruity rather than oily) goes to show just how influential distillation parameters are in creating flavor within a spirit, given that all else is the same.\n\nIt’s never right to choose between siblings, but in this case we have to: Glenlossie is the hands-down favorite at Alexander Murray & Co.",

However, what you can expect from all is exquisite bursts of flavor with great viscosity.\n\nA malt for enthusiasts with all the badges.",

    "description": "Causing confusion since 1797, Glen Garioch (yes it really is pronounced glen-GHEE-ree) has been responsible for a significant proportion of Scottish bartenders’ wry smirks in recent decades, since showing prominence as a frequently ordered single malt.\n\nIts name is Doric, which is an entirely incomprehensible dialect spoken in Aberdeenshire in Scotland, where men are ‘loons’ and women are ‘quines’, and where walking down the street, a sharp “fit like” is a genuinely friendly salutation. It all sounds odd, but these unique pastures represent the birthplace and heritage of Alexander Murray & Co.\n\nPerhaps a little biased, it goes without saying that Glen Garioch Distillery is a real favorite within the company. It is located in the sleepy town of Old Meldrum in the Highland region. Backed by real substance, its single malt is that rich malty/smoky combination that hits it home every time. Thick, sweet, lively, luscious… we need not say more.\n\nWorth noting is that through change of ownership during the mid 1990s, use of peat in production was ceased, meaning that vintages after 1995 are unpeated and display a delicate character. We hear there’s the odd peated run these days, so let’s see how that develops.",

    "description": "Colloquially known as ‘The Beast of Dufftown’ for very good reason. When James Findlater founded Mortlach in 1823, the first distillery in what would eventually become a prolific whisky-producing community, he created a single malt whisky so brutish and audacious in character that no person dare entertain the notion of altering its method of distillation, despite its convolution.\n\nDistillation here is configured in such a way that the No. 1 spirit still – known at the distillery as ‘Wee Witchie’ – is utilized to distill the ‘weak feints’ three times during the same run. The resulting spirit, according to the distillation team, is an aggregated 2.81 times distilled, and drawn diagrammatically is enough to leave you tipsy.\n\nAll of this tradition is upheld in order to promote a very meaty and sulfury spirit, which is so important for Diageo’s blending program, the distillery’s owner. As an extreme example of this style, Mortlach has robust body, which means it can withstand prolonged aging without succumbing to the flavor found in the wood in which it is matured, and if less mature or matured in refill casks, retains vibrant smoked-meat characteristics.",

The vast majority of Ardmore's whisky ends up in Teachers Highland Cream Scotch Whisky (one of the best selling blends in the world) where it's the main malt ingredient. In 1999, to honor the 100th anniversary of the distillery's opening, Ardmore (via Allied Domecq) began wide releases of their single malts.  In 2005, Beam Inc purchased Teachers, Ardmore, and Laphroaig, and have since allowed these brands to continue producing whisky the same as they had before.\n\nArdmore's single malts may throw some folks for a loop.  They may be expecting a Highland malt like Glendronach or Glen Garioch (its neighbors), with a fruity smokeless spirit.  But what they'll get is a solidly peated savory wallop, reminiscent of Islay malts.\n\nArdmore distillers have been peating their malt since the production began almost 115 years ago.  So they've kept the old-school Highland barley malt peat-drying method while most of Scotland went with more contemporary fuels.  The peat levels (12-14ppm) are 1/2 or 1/3 that of the Islay peat sluggers, but Ardmore also uses a local Highland peat that differs in structure and scent to that of the island peat.",

Rich, heady, supple on the palate, sweet and dripping from the sherry influence, that hedonistic splendor is intensified by the addition of peat and smoke.

    "description": "The Glen Ord distillery was built in 1838 in the plains to the north of Inverness, and was part of the Dewar’s family for most of the last century. In the '60s, their floor maltings were replaced with the popular Saladin Box and subsequently a drum malting was added. It became an important hub for malt in Northern Scotland and was eventually acquired by a predecessor of Diageo in 1985. Bottled under \"The Singleton\" brand for the Asian market, the distillery is not typically available in the US. This wild cask of heavily-sherried Glen Ord is an absolute wonder for us. We very rarely get offered Glen Ord and when we do it tends to be in 3rd or 4th fill blenders casks. While this doesn't necessarily mean the whisky is bad, it certainly doesn't provide the level of complexity that one might hope for, even with descent age. This fabulous Sherry butt shows us, once again, that age isn't everything. 8 years in a first-fill Sherry butt is enough to cut right through the raw spirit character of this bold northern Highlander. Full bodied, rich and full of spice, there will be few better deals in full-term Sherry coming this year. Bottled without coloring or chillfiltration at a cask strength of 57.5% abv.",

It is a perfectly balanced single malt with smouldering peat with briny influence, baked apple and cloves on the nose and flavors of lemon, vanilla syrup and fresh cut barley on the palate. It has a long and drying finish with gentle, sweet peat notes and black pepper. Campbel town is a small town on the west coast of Scotland. It was once home to over thirty distilleries in the Victorian Era. Now only 3 distilleries have survived through to the present day. Situated in the heart of Campbel town, Glen Scotia is one of the smallest distilleries in Scotland.\n\nThe Scotch distillery was founded by the Galbraith family in 1832. In 2014, the petite facility was purchased by the Loch Lomond Group. The distillery is quite small scale, outfitted with two 12,000 and 16,000-liter stills, with distinctive onion shapes and horizontal lyne arms. Glen Scotia’s line-up showcases their versatility, as they produced a range of peated and non-peated whiskies, two styles characteristic of Campbelltown, once known as the “whisky making capitol”. Their malt is sourced from eastern Scotland, and crafted in open-topped, cast iron mash tuns, and their whiskies are processed with a variation in fermentation time yielding either nuttier, or fruitier malts. Their small-batch distillation process still maintains much of the original equipment designs dating back to the 1830s.",

After our first effort importing casks directly from their bottled stock, we've stepped up to purchase exceptional whiskies straight out of their warehouses, which will be sold exclusively at K&L. This gorgeous barrel of nicely aged Glendronach represents a first for K&L and the USA—it’s the first independently bottled Glendronach (one of two barrels we purchased) we've ever seen in this country. If there has ever been an independently bottled Glendronach available in the US, it's been at least a couple of decades. This wonderful product, aged in a first-fill sherry butt, is everything we want from this distillery that they won't give us themselves.

The bottling offers up notes of coastal peat, toffee, honey, stewed fruits, raisins, figs, prunes, light sherry, a little toasted almond, tobacco smoke, a little chocolate fudge, oak, a hint of lemon, coffee, heather, and gentle herbs (bay leaf and rosemary particularly). Discreet and perfectly balanced.\n\nA consistently good bottling, every serious whisky fan should try this dram at some point.",

It is then directly bottled - not chill-filtered - to ensure the essential DNA and natural colour of our whisky stays intact. There is nothing in this whisky other than the whisky itself. Nothing but the intensely balanced, award-winning spirit of Highland Park. It is at once sweet and smoky on the nose, with aromas of violets and ripe vanilla pods amidst waves of aromatic peat smoke. On the palate, it is rich and full-bodied, with soft toffee, heather honey, freshly grated nutmeg, and sun-ripened citrus fruits that give way to an exotically spiced crème brûlée finish.",

In extremes of temperature and when you add water it may appear a little cloudy – this is the natural condition of a malt of such a peaty pungence and uncompromising purity. Adding a little water releases a rich aroma of peat smoke with some sweetness and strong hints of the sea. Emphatic, full bodied and utterly unforgettable – we like to think it’s the purists choice. A veritable aromatic feast of maritime notes: seaweed, iodine, pine needle, matchstick and olive brine. The palate entry is full of mint, Sherry, pork rind, bacon fat, chimney soot and rancio tastes; by midpalate flavors of cocoa, coffee, pipe tobacco, chocolate-covered orange, marzipan and vanilla extract proliferate.

    "description": "Original Cask Strength Laphroaig is bottled at natural distillery strength with all the depth of genuine taste and texture normally associated with sampling whisky at source. We mature Laphroaig in seasoned oak barrels, charred before filling to impart a slight sweet vanilla nuttiness. Original Cask Strength Laphroaig is barrier-filtered only just, to remove the small char particles present. This means you will enjoy Laphroaig exactly as we made it. In extremes of temperature and when you add water it may appear a little cloudy – this is the natural condition of a malt of such a peaty pungence and uncompromising purity. Adding a little water releases a rich aroma of peat smoke with some sweetness and strong hints of the sea. Emphatic, full bodied and utterly unforgettable – we like to think it’s the purists choice. A veritable aromatic feast of maritime notes: seaweed, iodine, pine needle, matchstick and olive brine. The palate entry is full of mint, Sherry, pork rind, bacon fat, chimney soot and rancio tastes; by midpalate flavors of cocoa, coffee, pipe tobacco, chocolate-covered orange, marzipan and vanilla extract proliferate. Luscious and stupendously good.",

    "description": "This special whisky is no less impressive than one of its older siblings—just for different reasons. The wonderful distillery on edge of Dufftown is one of the few that we haven't yet been allowed to visit. Their recent release of some proper single malt at an relatively affordable price point is one of the most successful new offerings from Diageo and a complete reversal from the dismal attempt they made to over-premiumize the distillery a few years ago. That said, no one questions the inherent quality of the top notch spirit coming out of Mortlach. We're always looking to offer something from them, young or old, because we know that no matter who picks it up, there's a great chance they'll enjoy it. The beefy, almost savory style isn't simply the result the distillery's predilection for sherry barrels, but the result of an unusual distillation schema equating to 2.81 distillations. We usually expect more distillation to offer a softer smooth product, but in this case the odd mixture of distilled heads and tails blended offers something far from expected. Never a slouch even if not coupled with the sherry it loves so well, this gorgeous cask offers you the true nature of this wild distillate on full display. A relatively active hoggie does little to tame the beast within. Bottled at 57.8%, add a bit of water.",

Reflecting the Highland provenance of the cup, which is in the collections of National Museums Scotland, he selected a parcel of spirit which had spent its life in ex-bourbon casks in the Distillery’s warehouses, not far from Glenmorangie House. Then in tribute to its French elements, he chose superior casks which formerly contained his most favoured sweet French white wines, including those of Muscat and Sémillon grapes, in which the expression would be extra-matured.",

He drew inspiration from unique stories related to the river and surrounding landscape. The American and European oak casks have been selected to create a flavour profile that will deliver a multifaceted experience; from the appealing rich brass natural colour, to the layers of aroma, followed by the deep and rewarding flavour.\n\nThe legendary River Spey flows through the Estate and is globally renowned as a home to the mighty Atlantic salmon. The Macallan Ghillie is a custodian of the River Spey and advocate for sustaining the wildlife in and around it. On our one-and-three-quarter mile stretch of river, a fortunate few can test their skills in the hope of catching – and releasing – wild Atlantic salmon using Hardy’s incomparable tackle.\n\nWild Atlantic salmon are at risk of becoming an endangered species. Therefore The Macallan are working with the Atlantic Salmon Trust to help raise awareness of this, and to support vital conservation work on the River Spey and beyond.",

    "description": "The first US release of single malt whisky from this exciting young English distillery. The whisky is a grain to glass operation with 100% of the barley coming from a local single farm source, in this case Bradwell Grove Farm. The harvested grain is sent to Warminster where it is 100% floor malted manually according to time honored tradition before it goes through its long, multi-day mashing and fermentation at the distillery. Distillation occurs through two passes in a bespoke Holstein pot still and the heart cuts are aged in ex-bourbon and reconditioned red wine casks for a minimum of three years. Give the whisky a few moments in the glass and watch the aromas and flavors slowly blossom with notes of rich butterscotch, apricot preserves, and ripe oranges. The whisky hits your palate with honey then switches gears to showcase the rich malt character at the core along with a long finish of mixed spices, cocoa and resin. This batch was produced from Odyssey barley harvested in 2014 and the limited small batch produced a total run of 1,920 bottles for the world.",

It's light-bodied with a palate that offers notes of honey, grain, pear, and lemon meringue. Light grapefruit flavors pick up into lemongrass, followed by the bitterness of orange peels and leather, anise, and copper.

(Some countries like the US require an age statement if it's aged less than four years.)\n\nChang calls this expression \"The most characteristic single malt whisky of Kavalan,” and I'd agree. For this expression, as opposed to the other standard single-malt, they do not use any rechar barrels, only first fill ex-bourbon. \n\nKavalan Sherry Cask whisky is aged in 500L sherry barrels.  Their first batch was aged in ex-european oak, but now they're moving to American oak. (Fun fact: most sherry is aged in American oak despite rumors to the contrary.)\n\nThe barrels come off a real sherry solera after 20 years or so, then they are seasoned with 20 years old oloroso before Kavalan gets them.\n\n(Many scotch whisky producers take new American oak barrels and season them with new wine for a few years so that it barely meets the legal aging definition of sherry, before being dumped and sent to Scotland. So it's not super common for the barrels to come off a real solera.)\n\nChang says the color of the whisky from the sherry comes though in just one month, but the whisky continues to age to between  6-7 years old.",

The whisky is matured in first-fill American Oak casks previously used for the maturation of bourbon, first for three years before being revatted into a fresh set of casks for a further 18 to 30 months.\n\nBain’s innovative double maturation ensures maximum extraction of flavours from the oak cask.

    "description": "Knob Creek is one of the special “small batch” brands of Beam-Suntory. Along with it’s sister labels — Booker’s, Baker’s, and Basil Hayden’s — it’s tailored to the more discriminating Bourbon-lover (and that means YOU). The Knob Creek brand was first launched in 1992, and since then they have changed it very little — remaining dedicated to reproducing a pre-Prohibition style Bourbon experience with a higher ABV that makes it a Bourbon-of-Choice for discriminating cocktail aficionados everywhere while winning awards and turning heads.\n\nTo tell you all about Knob Creek Quarter Oak we have to tell you about Whiskey barrels. Barrels are hard to get and expensive — every Spirits-producer on the planet wants them. Big barrels hold more using less wood per volume so they are on-average cheaper to use. Small casks give better Spirit to wood contact so the aging process is faster and more flavor gets into the Spirit. Knob Creek Quarter Oak is that wonderful Knob Creek signature Bourbon that we LOVE, but some of it has been rested in small, quarter-sized casks. This means that the vanilla and caramel flavors shine out even more.",

There aren’t many four grain bourbons on the market as they are very difficult to make. We utilize a stepped cooking process – each grain variety requires a different cooking temperature to maximize its flavor and character. The grain requiring the most heat is milled in and cooked first; the temperature is then lowered gradually as we add the smaller flavor grains and then complete the cooking process with the malts. This painstaking 6. 5 hour a labor-intensive process is critical to capturing the character and quality of each grain. During aging we strive to create harmony between this complex whiskey and the vanilla and caramel notes from the newly charred american white oak barrels to create a classic bourbon with colorado character.",

Using 10-year-old stocks of bourbon distilled at MGP in Indiana, BBCo finished each of the whiskeys for an additional 18 months in two different types of casks: American brandy and Muscat Mistelle. Made from 75% corn, 21% rye, and 4% malted barley, the Collabor&tion expression is aged in Mistelle barrels. It has an incredible viscosity and chewiness to its texture from the time spent in the used casks. Mistelle is unfermented grape juice (in this case, Muscat) fortified with unaged brandy (Muscat eau-de-vie) and then aged in bourbon barrels for 18 months. The empty barrels are deeply caramelized with the grape sugars and fruit essences, and the Collabor&tion whiskey aged in these barrels is pure joy. It's a completely novel sensory experience: deeply concentrated, rich whiskey that has a supple, fruity, and absolutely delicious finish. It's both a unique and divine tasting experience. Bottled at 47% cask strength ABV. NOTE: Due to the shape of the Collabor&tion bottle it cannot be consolidated with other bottles shipping and must ship in its own individual package.",

    "description": "We are 7 releases in and Bardstown Bourbon Company's Discovery Series just gets better and better. The Discovery has always been about blending the best whiskey possibly from meticulously sourced componenets and being transparent about what exactly went into the bottle. Discovery #7 marks a big shift in the blend and includes whiskey distilled outside of the United States for the first time. Here's the mashbill breakdown: 31% of the blend is 12 year old Kentucky Bourbon with a mash of 75% corn, 13% rye, 12% malted barley. 25% is 12 year old Kentucky Bourbon from 78% corn, 10% rye, 12% malted barley. 21% of the blend is Ontario distilled 12 year old 100% corn whisky. 15% is 7 year old Indiana Rye - 51% rye, 45% corn, 4% malted barley. And the final 8% is a whopping 17 year old Tennessee distillate 84% corn, 8% rye, 8% malted barley. The end result of all this is an incredibly smooth and approachable whiskey that steps outside tradition not for the sake of innovation, but because the fabulous results justify the approach. Distillery notes: Walnut and brown sugar with bursts of white flowers and tangerine create a delightful aroma leading to baked Honeycrisp apple and dark chocolate on the palate.",

When the Schenley Company (who introduced Ancient Age in 1938) sold the distillery and brand in 1983, Age International was formed. Age International was subsequently purchased by Takara Shuzo in 1991. Takara Shuzo retained the brands, but sold the distillery to Sazerac, which has handled their production ever since.\n\nNot Quite 10 Years Old\nAt one time Ancient Ancient Age did carry a 10 year age statement. However now-a-days the 10 is still on the label, but it is over the word STAR and is no longer associated with the time this bourbon has spent aging. In fact, “Aged at least 36 months” can be found written in tiny letters on the neck label. So, the current version of this bourbon is clearly much younger than its predecessor.",

Single barrel spirits come from (you guessed it) only one barrel, the best in the barn and often in the center. It is not diluted nor are any colors or flavors added. The flavor is big and unique. The proof varies from batch to batch. Blanton's Bourbon is typically around 93-proof.\n\nTaken from the center-cut or middle sections of the famous Warehouse H, Blanton's Original was once designated for ambassadors, dignitaries, and Colonel Blanton's family and friends.

    "description": "Blanton's is a bourbon brand from the portfolio of Age International, the company formed by former Fleischmann's Distilling director's, Bob Baranaskas and Ferdie Falke. They had approached Schenley in the early 1980s with a view to purchasing its Old Charter brand, but were instead offered Ancient Age and the George T. Stagg distillery where it was produced. The deal was completed in 1983, two years before the retirement of George T. Stagg master distiller, Elmer T. Lee, who had served there for 36 years, working his way from the bottom up. One of his final pioneering triumphs before doing so was the introduction of mass produced single barrel bourbon, specifically through the creation of the Blanton's brand in 1984.\n\nNormally a 6 to 8 year old bourbon, it is aged in Warehouse H at Buffalo Trace, which is the only metal-clad warehouse at the distillery, commissioned for construction by Albert B. Blanton, after whom the whiskey is named. The warehouse was built shortly after prohibition and being metal, transfers heat quicker than brick warehouses, allowing for more rapid ageing.\n\nThe popularity of these products was particularly high in Japan, coinciding with a market boom for American whiskey there in the 1980s. In 1991, with Age International in some financial trouble, a Japanese company called Takaro Shuzo stepped in and acquired a 22.5% stake in the company. In an unusual series of events, they then scuppered a deal the following year that was to see the remaining shares sold to Heublein (a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan). Their deal the year before had included a 30 day right of refusal to purchase the shares for themselves should they be put up for sale. With the deal all but done, the Japanese company stepped in on the final day of the window to acquire full control of the company. As it turned out, their only interest was in the brands, and they had used the 30 days to negotiate a deal with the Sazerac Company of  New Orleans. This saw the American company take ownership of the distillery (which they renamed Buffalo Trace in 1999), as well as the exclusive production and US distribution rights for the Age International labels. This is an arrangement that is still in place today.",

    "description": "The Colonel E.H. Taylor Bourbon is named for one of the founding fathers of the modern bourbon industry. Edmund Haynes Taylor, an honorary \"Kentucky Colonel,\" was a descendant of two presidents (Madison & Taylor) and one of Kentucky's last surviving Bourbon Aristocrats. The Colonel purchased the famous Old Fire Copper (O.F.C.) Distillery at the close of the Civil War. There he introduced scientific method to the production of bourbon, modernized equipment and set standards of production that became ubiquitous for quality bourbon production for the next century. He sold this distillery to George T. Stagg and it would eventually become known as Buffalo Trace. Taylor was a crusader for higher quality standards across the industry and ultimately help pass the 1897 Bottled in Bond Act. No single person can claim as much responsibility for the quality of modern bourbon whiskey as this man. This wonderful Bottled in Bond Small Batch Bourbon, named in his honor, has been extremely hard to get since its release in 2013. It's won countless gold medals in competitions around the world and a rare 5 star review from renowned spirits reviewer F. Paul Pacult. Some of our competitors feel comfortable charging upwards of $80 for this same bottle due to scarcity. In a world where getting a bottle of Elmer T. Lee, George T. Stagg, or Blanton's has become next to impossible, finding a bottle of Taylor for $40 is a coup. E.H. Taylor is right at home in the company of luminaries like these.",

    "description": "“George T. Stagg built the most dominant American distillery of the 19th century, during a time known as the Gilded Age of Bourbon. Uncut and unfiltered, this robust bourbon whiskey ages for nearly a decade and boasts the bold character that is reminiscent of the man himself” (Buffalo Trace Distillery).\n\nBuffalo Trace released their first Stagg Jr. in August of 2013 since then they have produced about two batches every year since. Each batch of Stagg is blended from bourbons aged approximately 8 or 9 years, and released at a high and unique barrel proof. Proof numbers are used to identify specific batches.\n\nFirst seen as too “alcohol forward,” Stagg Jr. has since been considered by many bourbon enthusiasts as a well-crafted barrel strength offering. It has all the rich and complex flavors you might expect of a strong bourbon straight from the barrel. Uncut and unfiltered, this robust bourbon whiskey ages for nearly a decade and boasts the bold character that is reminiscent of the man himself, Mr. George T. Stagg.\n\nMaster Distiller Harlen Wheatley describes that taste as, “rich, sweet, chocolate and brown sugar flavors mingled in perfect balance with a bold, rye spiciness. The boundless finish lingers with hints of cherries, cloves, and smokiness.”",

    "description": "The use of wooden barrels to store and transport liquids dates back to 2690 B.C., when ancient Egyptians during the Early Dynastic Period began replacing clay vessels with wooden casks in order to meet the demands of their sprawling civilization. The advantages of wooden barrels were evident — not only were they less fragile than clay vessels, but their cylindrical shape allowed them to be rolled rather than carried across short distances. As settlers along the Nile quickly realized, however, barrels made from wooden staves were rather porous — any liquids stored in the barrel slowly evaporated as the barrel \"breathed.\"\n\nAs whiskey ages in wooden casks, it evaporates through the pores of the wood. On average, approximately 2% of aging whiskey is lost to evaporation each year — this 2% is commonly referred to as the angel's share. In the United States, federal regulation requires that bourbon be made from a mashbill of at least 51% corn and aged in new, charred oak casks. Bourbon that meets these requirements and that has aged for a minimum of two years may be called straight bourbon.\n\nEach bottle of Rock Hill Farms Bourbon is aged about 8 years in a single, new, charred American oak barrel, and is bottled in bond at a robust 100 proof. Made from a mash bill of corn and malted barley, as well as more rye than typical bourbons, Rock Hill Farms Bourbon has a bit of spice to go along with its sweet notes of toasted nuts, fruit, chocolate and marshmallow. The bourbon finishes extremely smooth, with a lingering sweetness.\n\nNamed for the rich farmland along the Kentucky River that runs outside the Frankfurt distillery where the bourbon is made, Rock Hill Farms Bourbon was called \"The World's Greatest Bourbon\" by Washingtonian Magazine. In addition, Jim Murray awarded Rock Hill Farms Bourbon 95 points in Whisky Magazine, while Wine Enthusiast rated it 96-100 points.",

    "description": "Most of the whiskey labels in the US are now owned by big distillers with large collections of old and new brands. This is not a bad thing, but it's nice to know that there are still small family distillers left in America. At one time, immigrants from all over Britain, Ireland, and Scotland set up family stills to make use of their extra grain. The newly minted US government under George Washington was keen to impose an excise tax on these innocent farm products, which resulted in a citizen rebellion. Eventually, the government won out, and unlicensed distilleries were outlawed for good, leaving just a handful of well-funded companies to do business. The Wathen-Medley family tree goes back eight generations in Bourbon history, and today Charles Medley and his son Sam are at the helm of this 250-year-old brand.\n\nMedley's - 10 Year Straight 'Private Stock' 90 Proof Kentucky Bourbon was originally sold between the 1870s and 1940s. Fortunately, Charles Medley and his son Sam found an original bottle in the basement and decided to relaunch the brand, making it available just in time for the big holidays. There is very little available at the moment, so grab a bottle as soon as you can! It makes a great stocking stuffer. \n\nFlavor Profile: Made with a mash bill of 77% corn, 10% rye and  13% malted barley, this 90 proof Bourbon is a fitting style in a line-up among Wathen's Single Barrel, Old Medley 12 Year, and Medley Bros. 102 proof Bourbon.

    "description": "When Sam Medley came to me with these casks, we didn't have an official \"whiskey club.\" And since these casks were reserved exclusively for private whiskey clubs, I wasn't sure we could make it work. We once had something we used to call \"the whiskey club,\" - an insider’s list that gave people first crack at our special releases, but that system was done away with years ago. Instead to be a Spirits Department insider, all you need to do is click the box on your email preferences. While we don't have a standalone Whisk(e)y Club in the style of our wine clubs, we do have an alternative way for our customers to get monthly curated selections from our stocks. Many of our customers don't realize that K&L offers custom club called the Personal Sommelier Club. \n\nThe “Wine Clubs” are a very specific set of wines within our store that club members receive special discounts on through a monthly subscription. These are wines we select for a large group of people that we can offer exceptional exclusive pricing on to our members. Those who have joined one of our many wine clubs might have noticed that we do occasionally include spirits in those discounted offerings, but not as part of the monthly selections. But if you're one of those adventurous drinkers who love receiving a new bottle every month, you've got to try our Personal Sommelier Club. You won't always receive a discount, but you will get an awesome new bottle, hand selected by our experts each month. Just sign up online, change your preferences as often as you like and get access to our entire selection of discounted Wine Club wines in the store or online. You select the curator, the price and product type and you're all set. We provide you with a new bottle (wine, whisky, gin, brandy or whatever else you want) each month and sometimes we'll be able to offer you great casks like this one and certain other spirits at significant discount. \n\nNow about this cask, these are technically similar stocks to the ones we select Wathen's Barrel Proof from, but this barrel is completely differently from the Barrel Proofs last year. Those had an unusual grassy note and tons of earthy spice. This has a deep bouquet of sweet overripe stone fruit, kettle corn, candied apple and sarsaparilla. On the palate the high proof is totally masked by the butter sweetness up front before kicking up some spice on the back end. Very easy drinking considering the 126.52 proof, unctuous and rich on the palate, but doesn't forget its cask strength as it goes down.\n\nSo, just to recap, anyone can be in the K&L \"Whiskey Club,\" but it's a club of your own design. Just navigate to the \"Wine Club\" section of our website, select the Personal Sommelier Club from the list, choose you’re preferences, choose a price range and your favorite K&L Staff member as your Sommelier. If you were to pick bourbon less than $100, you'd be the proud owner of this special bottle at the discounted price next month. Conversely, you could sign up, buy it immediately at the discounted price and get different non-discounted bottle next month. The following month you'll get yet another great bottle handpicked by our staff.",

    "description": "The exceptional Wathen's brand is unique in that they're one of the few non-distiller producers that is contractually authorized to run their contracted distillery to their own specifications. That's because the owner and 7th-generation bourbon has earned the respect of his colleagues. He ran the Owensboro DSP-KY-10 plant until 1991, and after its closure made many attempts to restart the old distillery. Eventually the distillery sold, and the Wathen's sold the old stocks as they secured contracts for future production. Charles Wathens Meldey and his son Sam have slowly built the Wathen's and Medley brand, choosing to stick to their core brands rather expand the portfolio. We've had a great relationship with them over the years, but one thing they've never done for us is bottle full strength single barrel... until now! We're very lucky to be selected as one of only 25 accounts across the country to be offered a single barrel of cask strength Wathen's. In fact, only one other account in California got a crack at these special barrels. They're selected from a special experimental batch of barrels that were filled at significantly lower proof than normal. Medley usually fills at 117 and this special batch went in at 105. Lower entry proof means more maturity and depth in less time. This is one of the most inviting and complex cask strength barrels we've ever come across. After tasting at full proof I'm convinced it's Buffalo Trace though they won't confirm. An absolute triumph!",

    "description": "David Nicholson 1843 Bourbon Whiskey is one of the most sought-after bourbon's out there! This bourbon is amazingly smooth, and is the winner of the Double Gold at San Francisco World Spirits competition. 1843's award-winning taste is appreciated from coast to coast. David Nicholson 1843 was always a regional product and after Prohibition it was made by Stitzel-Weller for the Peter Hauptmann Company, or so said the label. Hauptmann was primarily known as a seller of tobacco products and he died in 1904. There is evidence that the company was in business until at least 1921, but nothing post-Prohibition. It is possible \"Peter Hauptmann Co, St. Louis, MO\" was just a Stitzel Weller DBA, validated as a 'real' address via a P.O. box.\n\nIn modern times, the David Nicholson 1843 brand was notorious within the small circle of hard-core bourbon enthusiasts for showing its distillery as DSP-16 (i.e., Stitzel-Weller) long after the supply of Stitzel-Weller whiskey was effectively exhausted. Luxco claims the error was a simple oversight, they just kept re-printing the label as it was. This is plausible since only bottled-in-bond (BIB) products must show the producing distillery on their label, and BIBs are a very small segment of the market. Likewise, David Nicholson 1843 has always been a very small brand, even for Luxco.\n\nAs a Stitzel-Weller product, David Nicholson 1843 was a wheated bourbon, the same basic liquid as Old Fitzgerald, W. L. Weller, Cabin Still and the rest of the line, including Rebel Yell which Luxco also now owns. It continued as a wheater even after the source of the whiskey changed.",

    "description": "In the early times, Early Times was a Bourbon.\n\nThen, in 1983, Brown-Forman, which purchased the old label back in the 1920s (that's right, during Prohibition), started called the stuff \"Kentucky Whiskey.\" This is not because the formula had changed at all. Rather, Brown-Forman began aging the liquor in used barrels, rather than the new charred American oak barrels required by law if one is to use the name Bourbon. No doubt this was a cost-saving measure.\n\nNow, Brown-Forman is rolling out the new barrels again. There will soon be two Early Times whiskeys on the shelf: the Kentucky Whiskey we all know; and  Early Times 354, a full-fledged Bourbon with a flashy new bottle. \n\nOne can easily tell the difference between the two. The old Early Times is smoothly and more innocuous. The new stuff has more spark, spice and depth. The 354 is not exactly Earth-shattering, simply a decent bench-level Bourbon. But I definitely prefer it, and it makes a decent Manhattan or Old Fashioned. \n\nBack in 1958, Early Times was actually America’s number one selling straight Bourbon whisky and Brown-Forman’s biggest seller. Don't know if history will repeat itself itself now, but anything's possible.",

    "description": "One of the things I love about bourbon is how something as little as the proof or the barrel selected for a bottle can change the flavor of a whiskey and therefore your opinion of it. This Single Barrel release from Fern Creek is a perfect example.\n\nFern Creek's first release - Small Batch - uses the same bourbon (mash bill and age) that are used for this Single Barrel release. The only differences are the barrels used, single vs. small batch, and the final proof in the bottle. But what a significant difference it creates in the finished product.\n\nThis Single Barrel release is bolder in flavor and has more complexity. As a result, the flavor profile is more in line with what I look for in a bourbon. That said, it's still very spice forward and a bit hot when taking your first few sips. I actually tasted Red Hots cinnamon candy when sipping this release. While those flavors caught me a bit off guard, they did an excellent job of offsetting some of the barrel tannins that were a bit overpowering in the Small Batch release.\n\nIf you like a big, bold and spicy bourbon, this one will be in your wheelhouse. A respectable proof point and excellent mouthfeel make this one fun to drink. If the price was $60 or under I wouldn't mind adding a few more bottles to my home collection given a chance.",

We located and purchased over 100 barrels of Kentucky Straight Bourbon ranging from 5 to 11 years old. And wanting to make a splash with our first release, we chose 14 of our oldest and most flavorful barrels of 11 year old whiskey and combined them into our secondary Ex-sherry rum casks and let them age. We tasted them regularly, being careful to not let the barrel finish overwhelm the bourbon that is already excellent. When Bill was comfortable with the finish, we dumped them at barrel proof into our bottles and out the door they went.  We dubbed the batch, aptly, “The Kelvin Collaboration.”",

The Frey family has been farming this land since 1953. Fifth-generation farmer Colby Frey saw grain and pure water and decided that Whiskey was a good bet. He started experimenting with distilled Spirits in 2006. Nevada relaxed regulations in 2010 opening the door to commercial distillation — Frey Ranch Whiskey Farm opened in 2014, boasting a beautiful Vendome still.\n\nFrey Ranch Straight Bourbon Whiskey just won a 2020 Whiskies of the World Gold Medal. It is a true estate operation with everything done on site from field to bottle. This a four-grain Bourbon and they raise their own — non-GMO corn, winter rye, winter wheat, and two-row barley. It’s continuously distilled in a 3-tower Vendome set-up and aged for four years in new oak. There is zero chill-filtration and cut to proof with the amazing snow-melt water to serve at 45% ABV for your pleasure.",

This is notably a bourbon rather than a Tennessee whiskey, though the criteria for the two styles mostly overlap. The nose is nutty and well spiced, with caramel corn, toasted pecans, cinnamon graham crackers, cherry tart, and butterscotch candies. There is a friendliness to the palate that makes it ideal for outdoor imbibing, with notes of spearmint, mixed berries, nougat, and honey. Big spice on the finish makes this a memorable sip. #5 Whiskey Advocate's Top 20 of 2021. This small batch bourbon is the first Dickel product to be labelled as \"bourbon.\" While most products from the Dickel line qualify under both Tennessee whisky and bourbon, only now is the famous old brand including that speical word on their label. This nicely aged release from the great distillery in Cascade Hollow is also one of the first younger age stated whiskies to be released by the storied brand in the modern era. Incredibly round and featuring classic bourbon aromas of vanilla, orange, bright cherry and complex oak. Aged in charred oak barrels for a minimum of 8 years and bottled at 90 proof.",

    "description": "Elijah Craig’s Barrel Proof releases, all limited-edition expressions of 12 year old, cask strength bourbon, have become collectible phenomena, snapped up on release and resold for well over asking price. This Private Barrel selected by K&L Wines in CA, is a 10 Year Old expression bottled at a natural strength of 64.10% ABV. This bottling was selected in a blind line-up of single barrel samples of varying age and proof. A consensus was reached by our staff with the input of a local spirit expert from one of our specialty suppliers and Heaven Hill's own representatives that the barrel we chose is extremely expressive, wonderfully balanced, and deeply satisfying. We get notes of cherrywood, maple, toasted oak, sweet spice and rich vanilla with a long finish. The tasting experience is heightened with a drop of water, amplifying aromas while simultaneously softening the palate to display a smooth, yet powerful, delicious dram.\n\n\"To sip Barrel Proof is to experience Bourbon in its purest form: uncut, straight from the barrel, and without chill filtering. Each bottle is hand labeled with its unique proof and batch number; but the nose, taste, and finish are pure Elijah Craig.\" - Elijah Craig Distillery.\n\nHeaven Hill is doubling down on Elijah Craig and revamping Barrel Proof beginning in 2017. While previous releases have been numbered with a simple and incremental numeric edition code, the company is doubling down on transparency by switching to a more detailed batch number.",

While things have modernized a bit, this whiskey is still decidedly old school both in character and cost delivering a reliable quality product for a solid value. The Bourbon is rich in flavors of pecan pie, apple streudel, cinnamon stick, maple syrup, roasted marshmallow and warm, buttered cornbread. There are a lot of expensive bourbons that are not worth the price tags that hang around their necks. While on the flip side there’s lots of cheap bourbon that over deliver what their prices promise. This is one of those bourbons. JW Dant is an old school bourbon that has resurfaced today. The whole experience is decadently sweet and savory. Creamy texture with notes of pecans, pastry crust, baked apples, clarified butter, and bonfire roasted marshmallows.

The bourbon, which is made from a mash of primarily corn, is the only extra-aged bottled-in-bond single barrel bourbon available today. Pursuant to the Bottled-In-Bond Act of 1897 (27 C.F.R. 5.21), any spirit labeled as \"Bonded\" or \"Bottled-in-Bond\" must be the product of one distiller at one distillery during one distillation season. In addition, the Act requires that bonded spirits be aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years and bottled at 100 proof.\n\nHenry McKenna Single Barrel Bourbon Whiskey is matured for a minimum of forty Kentucky seasons (ten years) before each bottle is filled and labeled with its batch and bottle number. As a result of its extra-long maturation period, the bourbon has an aroma of warm spices, smoke and burnt caramel. The aroma gives way to notes of chewy leather, chilli peppers and habanero, which are complemented by subtle touches of dried fruits, vanilla and cinnamon. The finish is warm and lush, with bold notes of roasted corn, cloves and woody spices. Since each bottle of McKenna's Single Barrel Bourbon is bottled from a single cask rather than being crafted from a batch of casks, however, each bottle is slightly different and entirely interesting.\n\nHenry McKenna 10 Year Old Bourbon was named one of the top 12 spirits ever tasted by Proof66 and was called \"magnificent\" by Jim Murray, author of the Whisky Bible. In addition, the bourbon earned a score of 90-95 points from Wine Enthusiast.",

    "description": "Hood River Distillers expands its lineup of bourbon with Trail’s End 10 Year Kentucky Straight Bourbon. This new bottle of Trail’s End joins the previously established Trail’s End 8 Year Kentucky Straight Bourbon from the distillery.\n\nThis new bottle of Trail’s End 10 Year is crafted with 10-year Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey that is then finished in Oregon Garry oak casks. Hood River Distillers sources its 10-year Kentucky Bourbon that comes from a select few barrels. The bourbon then makes its way westward along the path of the Oregon Trail where it arrives in Hood River to finish in toasted Oregon Garry Oak casks and blended with water from Mt. Hood to sit at 105 proof.\n\nTrail’s End 10 Year offers up aromas of vanilla and dried fruit without the heat that can be expected on a bottle over 100 proof. The palate is full of cherry, baking spices and subtle citrus brings for a pleasant sipper. It finishes smooth with a bit of spiciness lingering until your next sip.\n\nWhen compared to the Trail’s End 8 Year that sits at 90 proof, the new Trail’s End 10 Year at a bolder 105 proof ends up being a bit smoother than its younger sibling. The biggest difference is in the price of a bottle. Trail’s End 8 Year retails for $34.95 in Oregon while Trail’s End 10 Year retails for $59.95.\n\nThe release of Trail’s End 10 Year becomes the second whiskey collaboration between Hood River Distillers, the oldest distillery in Oregon, and the expert team at Clear Creek Distillery, the second-oldest distillery in Oregon.",

    "description": "At Maker's Mark, the wood-finishing series explores new, unique expressions of their signature whisky. Beginning as fully matured Maker's Mark® at cask strength, Private Selection is created by adding ten custom wood finishing staves to each barrel. It's then aged in their limestone cellar to extract a unique, flavorful taste profile. The finishing staves can be added any combination of five flavor profiles and with 1,001 possible stave combinations, each expression of Private Selection has a customized finish and unique taste profile, yet undeniably Maker's Mark. The Maker's Mark® Private Selection process differs entirely from any other major bourbon distiller and is unique to the Topflight Series in that it's not a pure single barrel. Our Topflight Series tasting panel sampled the current five oak stave types: Baked American Pure, Seared French Cuvée, Maker's Mark 46, Roasted French Mendiant, and Toasted French Spice. We then selected a combination for our 10 stave recipe, which was returned to the barrel for several months to impart flavors in our own unique recipe. I'm very excited to report that what we thought would be excellent when we created it back in March 2022 turned out to be outstanding.\n\nMy predominant tasting notes for this pour have been a few food phrases. Chocolate Cherries Garcia. Chocolate-covered bourbon barrel-aged cherries. Our selection guide said this was what he would imagine a Port-finished Maker's Mark would taste like. On the nose, (no surprise) cherries, almonds, chocolate, and toffee. The palate is where that chocolate comes through fully, which morphs from chocolate-covered cherry to raisinets as it finishes. There are amaretto and rum raisin elements that pop out at different points as well. Bottled at a cask strength of 110.6 proof, this incredibly smooth bourbon pour is unique in flavor and exceptional from nose to finish.",

When Diageo was making both brands, Old Charter was the same distillate. Both Jack Daniel's and Diageo's own George Dickel have comparable mash bills. Although they don't reveal their mash bills, the Buffalo Trace rye-recipe bourbon mash bill is believed to be similar.\n\nHirsch's source says the two releases have different mash bills, the NAS is 73 percent corn while the 15-year-old is 86 percent corn. Diageo American Whiskey Ambassador Doug Kragel also told AP that some of the 15-year-old is from New Bernheim, presumably made between 1992 and 1999.\n\nWho made the rest of it? We're told it will be essentially the same product they've been selling outside the U.S. I don't expect them to tell us the other sources, but in recent years Diageo is known to have purchased large quantities of bourbon distillate (e.g., millions of proof gallons annually) from Four Roses, Brown-Forman, Jim Beam, and Barton, which it aged at Stitzel-Weller. No one will confirm this, but the information is from a superb source. The warehouses at Stitzel-Weller are being emptied now because of the fungus issue.

    "description": "The principal author of the Declaration of Independence and one of the greatest Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson was elected the third President of the United States in 1800. During his tenure, Jefferson authorized the purchase of the Louisiana Territory, dispatched Lewis and Clark westward in order to explore the remainder of the continent, and repealed the Whisky Excise Tax.\n\nAfter Jefferson retired from public office in 1815, he often tended to the garden that he had cultivated on his Monticello estate. At the time, it was customary for wealthy farmers, including Jefferson, to distill the excess grains they harvested from their farms into spirits (George Washington was one of the country’s largest distillers of rye whiskey). As a result, each farmer’s spirits were unique and reflected the local terroir of their farm. Jefferson’s Ocean Aged At Sea Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey pays homage to Jefferson and the exquisite whiskey he distilled.\n\nBut the Ocean lineup is extra special in that it experiments with how maturing aboard a ship affects a spirit. The vessel in question is Ocearch's flagship, and this bourbon has traveled the world aboard that ship. The bourbon uses wheat in its mash bill as its small grain instead of the typical rye. The lighter wheat allows the sweetness of the corn to build through the maturation process. Once barreled and allowed to mature on land, it was put to sea, where it was immediately and continually influenced by the salt air and constant movement of the ship.\n\nTypically crossing the equator 4 times, the liquid is exposed to extreme changes in temperature as the ship transitions from winter to summer and vice versa without the buffer of spring and fall. Extreme heat changes cause the sugars of the corn to caramelize in the wood and work their way into the bourbon as the wood contracts with the extreme drop in temperature. Crafted with 7- and 8-year-old bourbons, this year's release marks a departure from previous ones.",

    "description": "Jeffersons Wood Experiment Bourbon Whiskey Collection The inspiration behind Jeffersons Wood Experiment Collection came from Trey spending time in a wine cooperage in Missouri. Wine cooperages are different than what you find in Kentucky as they have different treating processes, which focus more on toasting, slow cooking, and searing to bring different flavors to the forefront. It was at this point we asked, \"How could we change up what the final flavors of the bourbon are after we mature it in typical bourbon barrels? Trey started by putting 4 year old bourbon that had been aged in new charred white oak barrels, and finished it in 13 different environments/vessels. There were so many combinations to experiment with “ new bourbon barrels, new wine barrels, wine barrel heads on a new bourbon barrel, insert oak staves that have been seared, or oak cubes that have been slow cooked, etc. Over a period of 32 months, we charted the characteristics of each experiment monthly and analyzed how the different treatments have affected the outcome of the final whiskey. We decided to bottle them up in five 200 milliliter experiments so you can try five different experiments and see for yourself how these small changes make a vast difference. Jeffersons Wood Experiment was purportedly designed as an experimental aging program inspired by a visit to a wine barrel cooperage. Its an interesting concept. Wine barrels are almost exclusively toasted oak, and many wineries favor older used barrels for a more neutral flavor. This approach is almost diametrically opposed to bourbons pursuit of a high-oak flavor profile using charred, brand-new barrels. Heres how Jeffersons explains their experiment they took four-year-old straight bourbon whiskey and aged it in one of 13 different experimental aging environments, from toasted extra-large barrels to standard charred bourbon barrels with stave or cube inserts. Afterwards, the spirits were bottled in 200ml bottles and packaged in sets of five, with a seemingly random selection of five of the 13 different experiments in each set. For over 30 months, Jefferson's Bourbon Founder and Master Blender Trey Zoeller carried out 13 different experiments on fully matured bourbon by changing the conditions in which the bourbon was aged. Whether it was placing the already aged bourbon in new American oak casks with different char levels, changing the barrels to wine casks, or adding wood staves/cubes that have been treated, Zoeller did it. He charted the progress of these experiments every 30 days. This was developed along with the expertise of Independent Staves Company. The Jefferson's Wood Experiment Collection includes: Experiment No. 3: \"Creme Brule\" - Aged in New Amercian oak wine barrels with a low, deep impact toast profile which gives off a vanilla nut finish and smoky undertones Experiment No. 4: \"Chocolate Caramel\" - Aged in new, standard whiskey barrels with a medium char, infused with heavily charred American oak cubes that exert flavors of mocha, dark chocolate and caramel with hints of tobacco and leather Experiment No. 6: \"Vanilla Smoke\" - Aged in new standard whiskey barrels that have a light-medium char and infused with lightly toasted American oak cubes that emit smoky honey and vanilla flavors Experiment No. 10: \"Southern Spice\" - Aged in a custom French & American hybrid wine barrel with a low, deep impact toast profile that presents big, bold flavors of burnt caramel, plum, black pepper and maple Experiment No. 12: \"Cinnamon Apple\" - Aged in the original bourbon barrel with oak inserts that have been toasted over a long period of time to exert flavors of caramelized apples and plums with a bold cinnamon finish",

    "description": "Following the end of the American Revolutionary War, Johannes Reginald Beam emigrated from Germany to the United States, and eventually settled in Kentucky County. At the time, Kentucky County was still considered part of Virginia, and was overseen by a military governor named John J. Bowman. In order to encourage westward expansion, Virginia issued pioneers who agreed to settle in Kentucky County \"corn writs,\" which granted the pioneers 60 acres of land if they agreed to settle in Kentucky and start farming corn.\n\nAfter settling in Kentucky, Beam began harvesting corn and set forth a family tradition by distilling the excess grains he harvested into whiskey. Since then, seven generations of the Beam family have been involved in whiskey production for the eponymous company (the company is actually named after James Beam, who rescued it following Prohibition). Today, Fred Noe — a seventh generation master distiller and the great grandson of Colonel James B. Beam — shepherds his family legacy forward.  \n\nJim Beam Signature Craft Soft Red Wheat is one of two released in 2014. It is a light and approachable bourbon that has aged for the past 11 years. Best enjoyed neat and straight, or on the rocks if you prefer you will enjoy immensely it's delicate aroma. It has soft mildly oaky tones. To the palate there is a hint of spice and a delightful sweetness that clings, lingering with you.",

    "description": "From Jim Beam Signature Craft comes the Harvest Bourbon Collection, a series of hand-crafted bourbons that celebrate the distinctive tastes imparted by the distillation of different grains. More than ten years of aging has brought out the nuances of each of these unique ingredients. The High Rye bourbon has robust spice and rich oaky smoke on the nose. The taste is a balance of medium-bodied spice, with a hint of caramelized oak.\n\n\"Jim Beam Signature Craft High Rye 11 Year Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is the latest release in Jim Beam’s Harvest Bourbon Collection. While the whiskey still contains at least 51% corn (it must in order to be called “bourbon”) and some malted barley, the mashbill has an unusually high proportion of rye grains, lending a sharp, complex spiciness to the whiskey that is mellowed by the eleven years it spent aging in new American oak casks.\n\nAs a result, Jim Beam Signature Craft High Rye 11 Year Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey has an aroma of cinnamon, maple syrup and apple pie, which leads to a spice-driven palate filled with mint, clove, vanilla and gingerbread. The finish is wonderfully bold, with big notes of oak and rye coming together beautifully.\n\nThe Jim Beam Signature Craft Harvest Bourbon Collection represents an entirely unique approach to producing bourbon from a family that has been making it since the dawn of the American Revolution. \"\"If you get stagnant, people are going to stop looking at you,\"\" says Noe. \"\"Bourbon is hot all over the world.

    "description": "Featured prominently in classic American songs such as \"I Drink Alone\"by George Thorogood and preferred by James Bond is his old-fashioned cocktails, Old Grand-Dad is more than just a clever name — Old Grand-Dad was in fact a real person by the name of Basil Hayden who gained notoriety throughout the 1800s for making bourbon with a higher rye content. The elder Hayden passed down his passion for distilling to his son and then his grandson, R.B. Hayden, who honored his grandfather by dubbing the family's special recipe, \"Old Grand-Dad.\"\n\nThe Hayden family first established a commercial distillery in 1840, and Old Grand-Dad has been production continuously ever since. Even during Prohibition (by then, the bourbon had been sold to the Wathen family, another prominent whiskey family at the time), Old Grand Dad was one of just a handful of spirits sold as prescription medicine through the American Medicinal Spirits Company.\n\nOld Grand-Dad 114 Bourbon Whiskey honors Basil Hayden's longstanding Old Grand-Dad recipe by utilizing a higher rye content for a lighter, spicier bourbon. The bourbon's unique mashbill, combined with the barrel-strength bottling, results in a perfect balance of smoothness and flavor.\n\nOld Grand-Dad 114 Bourbon Whiskey is noticeably spicy on the nose, with strong oak notes and deeper hints of rye grains, leather and candied sugar. The bourbon's taste retains many of the spicier flavors, including pepper and tobacco, with the slight sweetness from the aroma becoming more discernible through touches of pear, apricot, vanilla and caramel that are evident on the palate. The finish is dominated by long-lasting notes of oak and vanilla.",

You experience nice brown sugar and caramel aromas with a hint of charred oak when you lift a glass of this batch to your nose, and the sweet caramel character continues in the taste, along with some bakery spice. It was a hot, humid day in Kentucky when I selected this batch, but the full-bodied taste will make it an ideal pour as the weather starts to turn crisp in the months ahead. With a clean, pleasant finish this batch is as inviting as the town that it’s named for – welcome to Booker’s Bardstown Batch.”",

The modern Peerless first debuted a rye whiskey, but the true heartbeat of this family is bourbon, and now that is set to beat again with the pending release of this American whiskey style from here.  It looks to be bottled at 54.45% ABV (108.9 proof), and no immediate price was mentioned. It should be noted as well that Kentucky Peerless takes pride in the fact that, all under one roof, “the select Kentucky Peerless grains are milled, cooked, fermented, double-distilled and barreled as bourbon & rye.”",

Along with it’s sister labels — Booker’s, Baker’s, and Basil Hayden’s — it’s tailored to the more discriminating Bourbon-lover (and that means YOU). The Knob Creek brand was first launched in 1992, and since then they have changed it very little — remaining dedicated to reproducing a pre-Prohibition style Bourbon experience with a higher ABV that makes it a Bourbon-of-Choice for discriminating cocktail aficionados everywhere while winning awards and turning heads.\n\nKnob Creek’s signature Bourbon is famously aged to taste. And a marvelous taste it is, too. But this dram is something different. Knob Creek 12 Year Old Bourbon has a bold age statement right there on the label — twelve years in new oak. And just like its younger sibling, Knob Creek 12 Year Old is bottled at 50% ABV. All you have to do is add up those stats — premium crafted Bourbon, aged twelve years, bottled at a high proof. What you have here is magic in a bottle my friend.",

    "description": "This is the first Knob Single Barrel since the lock down and the first barrel we've ever done with them picked by the Master Fred Noe himself. We don't take lightly our reputation for picking out the very best possible barrels from the great state of Kentucky, but if there's one guy at Beam we trust to make our selection it's man himself, Fred Noe. For those who don't know Noe, he's the 7th generation master distiller at Jim Beam and generally regarded as one of the industry's most important voices. Fred's been the head honcho over there for almost 13 years now and it's under his watch that Beam has expanded it's line up to include some of the most celebrated bourbons (and ryes) of the last decade. He also apparently throws a mean BBQ and if you ever get invited to his Bardstown backyard, you just say yes. But back to the bouborn. This barrel of Knob Creek is seemingly a baby compared to the 14-15 year old casks we've been accustomed to getting over the last couple of years, but whisky ain't gotta be old to be delicious. Clocking in just over 9 years old, it's still older than most every pick we get from Buffalo Trace. Bold and supple, this despite it's youthfulness, this is one of the most memorable Knobs we've had in some time. Distinct in that it's more remincient of the Booker's flavor profile than the standard Knob character. Deep barrel spice, sweet vanilla and robust old savory leather combine to offer a classic Beam profile that is rarely on display elsewhere.",

Take note of the change in aromas and flavors as your drink opens up Lemon, lavender, cherry, hibiscus, cinnamon, and tea notes may come and go as your tasting progresses. Use water to find the perfect strength for your palette. Some prefer iced for cool sipping, and some like the finish of full strength.\n\n\nThis rare bottling is a rare single barrel and cask strength edition from Lost Republic. Offered at 58% ABV.",

The brand was originally created by the Hoffman Distilling Company in Lawrenceburg, KY in 1957. In the 70s when Hoffman closed, the brand almost disappeared. It was revived the Luxco Company of St. Louis Missouri when they purchased the brand in 1993. It was an example for many years of how undervalued bourbon was in general, as old age statements sold for very low prices. But Luxco has successfully transitioned the brand to one of the most interesting labels on the market today and their new Lux Row Distillery is now bottling single barrels of this excellent high rye bourbon at what can still be considered very reasonable prices. This particular barrel was distilled on September 3rd of 2015 at what we can only assume was the Bernheim Distillery in Louisville. It was aged in warehouse 1, floor 1, Rick 43, position 2 and came out of barrel at 126.1 before being bottled at a very satisfying 107 proof.",

    "description": "In its sixth year, the Blood Oath ultra-premium bourbon series continues to see unique expressions – Blood Oath Pact No. 6 launches this spring. The series – a creation of Lux Row Distillers’ Head Distiller and Master Blender John Rempe – combines three selected bourbons, expertly blended for a distinctive whiskey.\n\nFor Pact No. 6, Rempe chose a 14-year ryed bourbon with notes of oak and leather, melded with an 8-year warm toasty ryed bourbon and complemented them with a 7-year ryed bourbon rested in cognac casks. The memorable combination brings caramel notes and hints of spice, along extra flavor from the cognac barrels.\n\n“This particular pact is special in that the cognac barrels added some sweetness and a slight fruity, brandy flavor to the bourbon, creating an amazing taste profile,” says Rempe. “When selecting these bourbons, I wanted to see how these flavors meshed together and I have to say the result was spectacular.”\n\nAs with all the other expressions, Pact No. 6 is a limited edition, never to be made again, with only 17,000 cases being produced and sold globally. This expression continues with the tradition of a 98.6 proof and packaged in an intricate wooden display box, with the 750ml bottle being topped with a natural cork and emblazoned with John Rempe’s signature. The suggested retail price is $99.99.\n\n“The Blood Oath series launched in 2015 and it’s hard to believe we have already created more than half a decade of Pacts,” adds Rempe. “I’m honored to see consumers searching for the new release every year and get as excited as I am when a new Pact hits the shelves,” adds Rempe.",

    "description": "Old Ezra’s owner, Luxco, historically has played the role of whiskey négoçiant, sourcing liquid from third-party distillers. In 2018, the company opened its own distillery in Bardstown, Ky., where it’s now laying down whiskey. While we wait for it to mature, we’ll happily savor the sourced version. This is Ezra Brooks’ first ever barrel-proof bourbon, and it’s a beauty. A spice storm of cinnamon, clove, ginger, and roasted pecan greets the palate, easing into sweet notes of melted caramel, chocolate, macaroons, marzipan, and crème brûlée. Earthy hints of sandalwood and tobacco complete the finish, making this everything a great bourbon should be. —David Fleming",

They are one of the few distilleries that rotate their barrels from the upper to the lower levels of the aging warehouses during the aging process. This ensures that the barrels get equal treatment, evening out the differences in temperature fluctuation that occurs during the maturation process.\n\nThis is the first new Makers Mark recipe in at least five decades. Maker’s 46 is Maker’s Mark with a French Twist. A full-fledged Maker’s Mark, aged for an extended period in seared French oak staves. The staves were sourced from the Independent Stave Company, who experimented with 10 virgin French oak staves, testing several different levels of sear to caramelize the wood sugars and seal in the bitter tannins of the oak.\n\nThe final staves, labeled “Profile 46,” were then added to the barrels of original Maker’s Mark, and aged in Maker’s limestone bourbon cellars. The French oak staves create a smoother, bolder, more complex flavor profile, imparting more spice, sweetness, and vanilla onto the spirit.

    "description": "In the 18th century, a Swiss Mennonite farmer by the name of John Shenk settled his family near Pennsylvania's Blue Mountain Valley. After a few years of hard work and long hours, Shenk was harvesting more grains that he could sell at the local market. As a result, Shenk purchased a still and began distilling the excess grains he harvested into whiskey. His distillery, which was eventually named Michter's, became the United States' first distilling company.\n\nThe passage of Prohibition in 1919 forced Michter's, along with nearly every other distillery in the United States, to close. In the early 1990s, however, Joseph J. Magliocco teamed up with Richard Newman in an effort to resurrect the brand. \"When we set up our whiskey program for Michter's,\" says Magliocco, \"Dick and I wanted to get back to the \"cost be damned' roots and produce the finest whiskey possible. Our goal was to show that whiskey made in the United States could be the equal of great whiskey made anywhere in the world.\" The bourbon has an aroma of apricots, nutty dough and cracked pepper, along with notes of sweet corn and vanilla on the palate. The finish is well-balanced, and ends with notes of raisins and plums. Michter's US*1 Small Batch Bourbon Whiskey earned four stars from F. Paul Pacult's Spirit Journal, and earned a score of 90-95 points from Wine Enthusiast.\n\nMichter's Small Batch Bourbon represent unique, limited edition expressions of whiskey from one of the oldest brands in the United States.",

Our family bourbon is sweet mashed using fresh non-gmo local grains and pure Gallatin County, Kentucky limestone water.  It is then fermented in open-top cypress at cool temperatures, allowing our yeast ample time to produce their great flavors.  Royce then triple pot distills his bourbon on the grain, cutting out the impurities using his taste buds only; the traditional way.  Royce then enters his whiskey in local Kentucky made barrels and allows mother nature to take over.\n\nOur bourbon is non chill filtered and bottled at barrel proof right out of the barrel, preserving the rich flavor of the bourbon (you might even see char dust from the barrel in bottle).  This bourbon is of the same high quality that has allowed our family distilling tradition to survive both legally and illegally 11 generations.",

    "description": "Nevada H&C Distilling produces the Smoke Wagon line-up of whiskeys. The Small Batch Straight Bourbon was born of a brainstorming process to solve a particularly thorny problem they were having with bottling an aged, high-rye whiskey that met their profile preferences and standards. Because rye typically ages much faster than corn-based mash bills, the aged high-rye spirits often lost their spicy rye components after successive years and rackings. At the same time, the younger rye spirits exhibited all the bold and spicy components they were seeking, but the palate was often lacking in the sweet, rich texture that aging brings. The solution was to blend and bottle and combination of old and young ryes, thereby capitalizing on the desirable characteristics of each in the finished product. Bottled at 100 proof, the Smoke Wagon Small Batch carries all the depth, body, and richness of an aged spirit the with robust spice of rye and #4 char oak.",

The resulting spirit is a masterpiece of complex, dark flavors with a deep spice finish.\n\nAt 118 proof (59% ABV), the new Cask Strength Bourbon is a “deeper, darker, more robust version of its beloved 98.4proof fruit-forward sibling (aka The Musician), offering a nose of brandied cherries with fresh muddled mint, old fashioned blackberry cobbler with a biscuit crust, and cinnamon toast in brown butter,” according to Fraley. “The palate offers notes of grilled peaches drizzled with balsamic vinegar, butterscotch pecan pie, and dark brown sugar, followed by warming waves of rye spice, nutmeg, and clove.”",

    "description": "Originally opened on Derby Day in 1935, the fabled Stitzel-Weller Distillery — one of the true “cathedrals” of the bourbon industry — ceased production in 1992, and just recently reopened to the public in 2014. Although no whiskey was distilled at Stitzel-Weller for over 20 years, other distilleries sent their whiskeys to age at there; located just five miles from downtown Louisville, KY, Stitzel-Weller is known to have extremely favorable conditions for aging.\n\nThroughout the Stitzel-Weller Distillery, the “five keys” symbol appears frequently — each key represents a step in the whiskey-making process: grains, yeast, fermentation, distillation and aging. Blade and Bow Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, one of the first releases in over two decades to utilize actual whiskey distilled at the Stitzel-Weller Distillery, is named after the blade shaft and ornate bow handle that together comprise the two parts of Stitzel-Weller’s iconic skeleton keys.\n\nBlade and Bow Kentucky Straight Bourbon is crafted using a solera-aging, a process typically reserved for aging cognacs, ports and sherries. This is done to preserve the precious original stock of Stitzel-Weller, which is mingled with other fine whiskies during the solera process, during which a series of casks are filled at different intervals over a long period of time (in fact, Blade and Bow Kentucky Straight Bourbon contains the oldest remaining stock of whiskey distilled at Stitzel-Weller, and will be the last available liquid for sale that was distilled at the original distillery).\n\nAs whiskey from the oldest cask is emptied and bottled, the cask is refilled with an equivalent amount of whiskey from the second-oldest cask in the solera. This cascading effect continues until the youngest cask in the solera is filled with new whiskey. As a result, no cask in the solera is ever fully emptied. In addition, as the younger whiskey ages and cascades through the solera, its average age and complexity gradually increase over time.\n\nBlade and Bow Kentucky Straight Bourbon has a restrained nose with hints of citrus, mint, oak and green apple. The palate is slightly fuller, with touches of apricots, figs and pears mixed with cereal grains, and leads to an easy finish with caramel, burnt oak and cinnamon spice.\n\nBlade and Bow Kentucky Straight Bourbon is the final chance to try the last remaining whiskey distilled at the original Stitzel-Weller Distillery.",

    "description": "Taconic distillery’s home is the iconic Hudson Valley. Saturated with National Historic landmarks, the area boasts bountiful farms. With a fervor for the rustic outdoors and a strong desire to work the land, the Coughlin family purchased a portion Laured beef Farms, in Stanfordville, NY, in 2010. Renaming it Rolling Hills Farm. To maintain an unadulterated flavor of the whiskey, Taconic never chill filters, and distill their whiskeys below 160 proof to retain the flavors from the grains. It is the flavor of the grains that are transferred through the distilling process as fatty molecules or “flavor oils” which results in a “cloudiness” in the whiskey. Those flavors are transferred through the distilling process as fatty molecules (flavor oils). Some distillers will chill filter the fatty molecules and sacrifice a certain amount of flavor for clarity.\n\nTaconic uses distinct Coopers Select, Char #3 new oak barrels made by the Independent Stave Company. Their barrels have a unique maturation process; aged in shipping containers. Less is lost to the angel’s share, due to the saturation of the air inside the containers. Being exposed to great temperature fluctuations, results in greater movement of spirit in and out of the barrel staves. Aging occurs in cycles, during times of increased temperature such as in the summer, the whiskey expands through the char, through to the untreated wood beneath. While in the wood, the whiskey dissolves various flavorful compounds. When temperatures drop, the liquid contracts and brings out all of the flavors of the wood, producing flavors that complement the body of the whiskey.\n\nTaconic’s award-winning Dutchess Private Reserve Straight Bourbon Whiskey is described as being subtle and sophisticated. “A beautiful bouquet of spice and honey with gentle notes of vanilla coming out to provide for a smooth finish. This is a bourbon for sharing with friends”",

Of almost equal importance, the purchase of the distillery included the contract of legendary master distillery, Jimmy Russell, who started working there in 1954. His name is synonymous with the brand, and his son succeeded him 2015. In 2011 a new Wild Turkey distillery was built on the same site, replacing the original Ripy plant after 76 years.\n\nA special release bourbon which was carefully selected from the distiller's favourite reserves.

This fact just serves to make this bottling even more special.\n\nThe bottling is a blend of some of the oldest stocks in the Wild Turkey reserves, aged for between 12 to 15 years. This Bourbon has been made with a mashbill of 75% corn, 13% rye and 12% malted barley. After initial aging, the Bourbon has been finished in Oloroso sherry casks which have held the fortified wine for at least 20 years. Rumour has it that Eddie Russell (Wild Turkey’s Master Distiller) had to go to enormous lengths to procure these older barrels. These sherry casks have imparted incredible depth to this bottling.\n\nThe result is a dazzling and delicious American whiskey which serves up notes of caramelised peaches, candied orange rind, peppermint, boiled sweets, candied apples, rich vanilla custard, pecans, cherry pie, raspberry, red grapes, dried fruits, cinnamon, nutmeg, rye, mint, almond, dark oak, leather, corn brightness, pepper, maple syrup, pastry, apricot and burnt brown sugar.\n\nThe whiskey is bottled at 50.5% ABV for a richness of flavour and mouthfeel.\n\nA wonderful, and rare combination of top quality Oloroso casks and Bourbon, this bottling comes with a charming presentation box.",

You wanted to get in the business. My grandfather and my father, me, and now my son, we've all been in the business.\" Famous for the bold and spicy flavors the duo's higher-rye recipe and lower barrel entry proof produces, Wild Turkey uses only the best ingredients, which included 100% American grown non-GMO grains and limestone filtered water from the Kentucky River.\n\nWild Turkey 101 Bourbon is crafted using a high-rye mashbill, which gives the bourbon a unique and spicy flavor profile. Once the bourbon has been distilled, it is aged in American oak casks that have been charred with a #4 char. Typically, the degree of charring within a cask is measured on a scale of one to four, with a #1 char referring to casks that have been lightly toasted, and a #4 char referring to casks that have been charred so heavily that the interior resembles an alligator hide.\n\nAfter maturing for a minimum of five years, Wild Turkey 101 is bottled at 101 proof. The bourbon has an aroma of brown sugar and spice that give way to bold notes of caramel, vanilla, more spice and notes of citrus and orange zest on the palate.

During Reconstruction, John David Willett — the family patriarch — began distilling whiskey at the Moore, Willett & Frenke Distillery, which was situated just outside of Louisville, Kentucky. In 1898, his son, A. Lambert Willett — who was 15 years old at the time — began following in his father's footsteps. Three decades later, Lambert, together with his son, Thompson purchased a farm on the outskirts of Bardstown, Kentucky, and began construction of the Willett Distilling Company. While the Willett Distilling Company eventually changed its name to Kentucky Bourbon Distillers, the family tradition lives on — Even Kulsveen, the current owner of KBD, is Thompson Willett's son-in-law.\n\nIn keeping with family tradition, Willett Pot Still Reserve is a mean single-barrel Kentucky straight bourbon. Aged for between eight and ten years, Willett Pot Still Reserve earned the Gold Medal for taste at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition in 2008, and the Double Gold Medal for design. Its unique shape and design are meant to resemble the pot still that was used for generations at the Willett Distilling Company.

    "description": "Born in 1952, Old Bardstown was an American Thoroughbred racehorse named after the city of Bardstown, Kentucky. Bred and raced by Calumet Farms, the horse twice won Florida's Tropical Handicap at the Tropical Park Race Track as well as the Widener Handicap at the Hialeah Park Race Track. In 31 career starts, Bardstown had 18 first place finishes, 7 second place finishes and 1 third place finish. By the time he retired at the age of 8, Old Bardstown was one of the top racing horses of his time.\n\nOld Bardstown Estate Bottled-in-Bond Whiskey pays homage to the legacy of the American Thoroughbred. The bourbon is made from a large amount of malted barley (15%) in the mash, which is fermented with Kentucky limestone water. Following fermentation, the wash is distilled before the bourbon is matured for ten years in new, American oak casks. Then, the bourbon is brought to 100 proof before being bottled.",

    "description": "The Woodford Reserve Distillery sits on what was once an old Distillery founded by Elijah and his son, Oscar Pepper, in the 1800s. Under the stewardship of Oscar and Master Distiller James Crow, their distillery reformed and modernized the process of producing whiskey in the United States — the distillery revolutionized the concepts of sour mash and yeast propagation.\n\nNearly two centuries later, Chris Morris — Woodford Reserve's seventh master distiller — pays homage to Pepper and Crow with Woodford Reserve Double Oaked Bourbon. Morris, who began working at Woodford Reserve Distillery when he was just 16 years old, is one of the foremost experts in the production and maturation of bourbon and samples up to 180 unique whiskies each day. “It's about pursuing flavor through modernizing old practices,” says the 55 year-old master distiller.\n\nWoodford Reserve Double Oaked Bourbon take's Woodford Reserve's award-winning Distiller's Select bourbon and finish ages it in a second heavily toasted and lightly charred barrel. The heavy toast from the bespoke cask contributes notes of honey, cream and vanilla to the bourbon, which are well-complemented by sweet aromatic notes contributed by the light char. “Double the maturation, double the wood exposure,” says Woodford Reserve Master Distiller Chris Morris. “That is the secret to the Double Oaked character. The second barrel tells the story.”\n\nWoodford Reserve Double Oaked Bourbon has an aroma of cinnamon, vanilla and light chocolate, which leads to mellow notes of oak, baked apples, brown sugar and raisins on the palate. The flavors are subtle and tamer than expected, and lead to a long, sweet finish. The bourbon earned the Double Gold Medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition in 2013, and earned a score of 93 points from Wine Enthusiast.\n\nThe Woodford Reserve Distillery is among Kentucky's oldest and smallest bourbon distilleries. Nestled in the heart of the Commonwealth's thoroughbred country, it's the only place you'll find bourbon and horses maturing side by side. It's also the only spirits company in the world to own its own cooperage and crafts its own barrels, allowing for ultimate precision when creating the Double Oaked Barrel and its exact toast and char specifications.",

As such, American Distillers have begun to experiment with different ways of giving their whiskey a unique flavour profile, after all, necessity is the mother of invention.\n\nThis is one such example, a Bourbon which unusually uses smoked malted barley in its mashbill (in a ratio of 70% corn to 30% barley). Here the barley has been smoked with Cherry Wood, imparting a fragrant fruitiness to the finished product.\n\nIndeed, this whiskey serves up notes of fresh berries, cherries, sweet wood smoke, barbequed meats, vanilla, coffee, blackcurrant cordial, brown sugar, cinnamon, corn sweetness, and hot oak.\n\nThe dram is bottled at a strength of 45.2% ABV, for a little more intensity.\n\nA complex and delicious Bourbon with a difference!",

    "description": "The story of Woodinville began with two best friends with a passion to make the greatest craft whiskey in the world. Woodinville whiskeys are made by time-honored traditions of bourbon production, using the highest quality locally grown grains, the best barrels, and coopers in the world, the most technologically advanced distilling equipment, and the wisdom of an industry legend, the late David Pickerell.\n\nWoodinville has already received notable accolades including \"Craft Whiskey of the Year\" for their Straight Bourbon, and \"Craft Rye Whiskey of the Year\" for their Straight Rye by the American Distilling Institute in 2018 and 2017 respectively. All of the grain used in production is grown exclusively for Woodinville whiskeys on the Omlin Family Farm in Quincy, Washington, run by third-generation farmers, Arnie and Phyllis Omlin.\n\nThe locally sourced grains are mashed, distilled, and barreled in their Woodinville distillery, before heading over the Cascade Mountains to their private barrelhouses, where Central Washington’s extreme temperature cycles stimulate the extraction of natural flavors from the oak. Before being coopered, the barrel wood used for maturation is open air seasoned for eighteen months, allowing the elements to soften the wood’s harsh tannins.\n\nThe barrels are then slowly toasted and heavily charred to further enhance the wood’s most desirable flavors. This meticulous process delivers a hand-crafted spirit with rich aromas of crème brûlée and spice cabinet, and decadent notes of rich caramel, dark chocolate, and vanilla bean on the palate with a sweet, lingering finish.",

    "description": "A.D. Laws Whiskey House is a grain-to-glass distillery in Denver, Colorado that applies a “there are no shortcuts” philosophy to each batch of whiskey produced. Each batch is milled, cooked, fermented, distilled, and aged on-site, utilizing heirloom grains from family-owned Colorado farms. The practice of open air, on-grain fermentation captures the essence of Colorado’s terroir while the copper pot-column still produces a robust, grain-forward style of whiskey that is aged in 53 gallon charred oak barrels.\n\nSecale Straight Rye takes its name from secale cereale, the Latin term for the rye grain. The unique terroir of the San Luis Valley in southern Colorado imparts a perfumed quality to the grain, while a mash consisting of 50% raw and 50% malted rye produces a whiskey that balances the cereal qualities of malted grain with the assertive spice profile of its raw counterpart. The final result is a distinctly nuanced rye whiskey unlike any other.\n\nMash Bill: 95% heirloom rye, 5% heirloom barley",

At the time, the territory was considered part of Virginia, and was overseen by a military governor named John J. Bowman. In order to encourage westward expansion, Virginia issued pioneers who agreed to settle in Kentucky County \"corn writs,\" which granted the pioneers 60 acres of land if they agreed to settle in Kentucky and start farming corn.\n\nOne year after the defeat of the British, a Baptist minister named Elijah Craig emigrated to Fayette County (today, a part of the State of Kentucky) and purchased 1,000 acres of land in a town named Lebanon. In 1789, Craig built a distillery on his farm and is credited with being the first person to mature bourbon in charred, oak casks, earning him the title \"Father of Bourbon Whiskey.\" Elijah Craig Small Batch Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey pays homage to Craig and his unique legacy. The bourbon is bottled from the marriage of fewer than 100 casks of maturing bourbon, each of which is rested in a Kentucky rickhouse for a minimum of a dozen years.\n\nElijah Craig Kentucky Straight Rye is crafted with a mash bill of 51% rye, 35% corn, and 14% malted barley. The classic recipe has a high percentage of corn in line with post-Prohibition standards that have brought on the resurgence of the style. This brings it close to bourbon, making it a popular choice for bourbon fans and rye aficionados alike. Bottled at 94 proof, it's a balanced and approachable spirit that showcases Elijah Craig's attention to detail and signature smoothness.",

    "description": "Following the end of the American Revolutionary War, Johannes Reginald Beam emigrated from Germany to the United States and eventually settled in Kentucky County. At the time, Kentucky County was still considered part of Virginia and was overseen by a military governor named John J. Bowman. After settling in Kentucky, Beam began harvesting corn and set forth a family tradition by distilling the excess grains he harvested into whiskey. Since then, seven generations of the Beam family have been involved in whiskey production for the eponymous company (the company is actually named after James Beam, who rescued it following Prohibition).\n\nKnob Creek Bourbon was created by Beam’s grandson, Booker Noe, who after joining the family business in 1950 was promoted to Master Distiller just ten years later. Booker talked like a true Kentuckian and was known for his contagious personality, and through his launch of the “Small Batch Bourbon Collection” — the collection includes Knob Creek as well as Basil Hayden’s, Booker’s and Baker’s bourbons — he is often credited as the father of the small batch bourbon movement.\n\nKnob Creek Bourbon takes its name from the small water source, Knob Creek, that ran through President Abraham Lincoln’s childhood farm. Booker’s vision for Knob Creek Bourbon was that of an honest, quality bourbon that could meet the standards — strength, flavor, care, and patience — of bourbon made before prohibition distressed the industry just decades earlier. Like Abraham Lincoln himself, Booker designed Knob Creek Bourbon, to be honest, unwavering and full of character.\n\nKnob Creek offers a solid core lineup of whiskeys and bourbons, all of which have made the brand one of the most popular labels on the market today. Rye Whiskey has made a huge comeback in the industry in recent years, and Knob Creek’s small batch rye is a hallmark emblem of the resurgence of this born again fermented grain whiskey. With its expansive notes of herbs bold rye and nuanced elements of oak, and undertones of vanilla, it's no wonder that this rye is one of the most renowned whiskeys to date. Although they do not reveal its age statement (instead claiming “aged patiently” on its label), and information about their grain source is also undisclosed (instead stating that they source the “highest-quality rye to create the World’s Best Rye”), this exceptionally nuanced and flavorful whiskey won \"Best Rye Worldwide Whiskey\" at the 2016 International Wine and Spirits Competition.",

He sold the company to his employees in 2014 and used the funds to launch New Riff Distillery with co-founder Jay Erisman in Newport that same year — just across the river from Cincinnati, Ohio. As head distiller Brian Sprance was distilling Spirits and laying down casks for aging, they sourced Spirits from MGP in Indiana and sold them under the O.K.I. band (now retired). They are now releasing their own complete line of house-crafted Spirits and are an official stop on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail.\n\nNew Riff Malted Rye 6 Years Old is a bonded Whiskey that’s made entirely from malted rye. Now, that’s not unseen but it is rare. The result is much more subtle than unmalted rye and begins with a light and sweet nose that evolves into a fruity and malty palate with apple, fresh berries, and brown sugar.

The result is a bright and busy whiskey whose all-rye mashbill gives it loads of grain character made even more delicious by those secondary cask influences.\n\nOn the nose is an explosion of rye spice, a pour that practically climbs out of the glass and attacks the nose in a good way—as only a cask strength can. If you have a Glencairn Mixer glass or a NEAT glass, use that instead of a tightly focused nosing glass. Pour the whiskey, walk away for a few minutes and let some volatile ethanol leave the glass. When you return, the aromas will be tamed and delightful: cinnamon, golden raisin, dried strawberry, butter cookie, oak, dried rye grain and anise. Eventually dank wood and warmed honey emerge.\n\nTo the palate comes lemon curd, cooked fruit, figs, Nutella and toasted bread.

The mashbill for Pikesville consists of 65% rye. In the States it is mostly used for cocktails and is dirt cheap.\n\nThe nose is light, but also somewhat bitter. That luckily disappears quickly to make room for vanilla, coconut and lavender. Mildly spiced on ginger and nutmeg. It remains grainy though. Leave it for ten minutes and nothing will be left. Carton creeps in.\n\nOn the palate is balances between watery and oily. The rye now speaks louder with a voice of pepper, nutmeg and even some chili. Vanilla and coconut again, but also very grainy. Too much so to be good. A hint of raisins.\n\nThe finish is medium long and soft, but the bitterness is much louder than the sweetness.\n\nThis one is on par with Heaven Hill’s Cabin Still bourbon.

The distillery operated continuously for nearly fifty years until the 18th Amendment, which prohibited the sale of alcohol in the United States, was ratified. Following the end of Prohibition, the Ripy Brothers Distillery was reopened and a distillery executive named Thomas McCarthy took samples of maturing whiskey from the distillery on a turkey hunt with a group of friends. The next year, his friends asked him to bring \"some of that wild turkey whiskey\" on their next hunt, giving birth to the distillery's new name.\n\nToday, Wild Turkey Distillery is stewarded by Master Distiller Jimmy Russell and his son Eddie Russell (together, the pair have over 90 years of experience producing bourbon). \"I was born and raised in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky,\" says Jimmy, \"which was a small community when I was growing up, but there were four bourbon distilleries here, and you had families working all the distilleries. You wanted to get in the business. My grandfather and my father, me, and now my son, we've all been in the business.\"\n\nWild Turkey's Rare Breed releases have turned out to be some of the tastiest they've put out with countless fans and awards to prove it: several Double Gold Medals at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Gold Medals at the International Wine & Spirits Competition, and numerous others.

    "description": "Russell's Reserve 6 Year Old Small Batch Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey is made using a generations-old recipe. After the grains are mashed and fermented, they are distilled to a lower proof than at other distilleries in Kentucky, meaning that less water is used in diluting the whiskey before it is matured and bottled. Following distillation, the rye is aged for a minimum of six years in American oak casks that have been charred with a #4 char. Typically, the degree of charring within a cask is measured on a scale of one to four, with a #4 cask referring to casks that have been charred so heavily that the interior resembles an alligator hide (#4 casks are nicknamed alligator-charred casks). The heavy char used in the maturation of Russell's Reserve Rye contributes bold notes of honey, wood tannins and cinnamon to the whiskey, and complements its spicy notes of rye.\n\nAfter the rye has matured for a minimum of six years, Russell and his son, Eddie (together, the pair have over 90 years of experience making whiskey), hand-select individual casks of rye whiskey to marry together. Once the casks have been hand-selected, the whiskey is brought to proof and bottled by hand.\n\nRussell's Reserve 6 Year Old Rye has an aroma of vanilla, marzipan and spiced toffee. The aroma gives way to bold notes of rye, allspice, cinnamon and cloves on the palate, and finishes with spicy notes of toasted rye bread and roasted nuts.\n\nRussell's Reserve Rye Whiskey earned the Double Gold Medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, where it was named \"Best Rye Whiskey,\" and earned a score of 96-100 points from Wine Enthusiast. In addition, it was rated one of the top six rye whiskies by Drink Spirits, which said: \"If you are looking for the best expression of rye in a whiskey, Russell's Reserve 6 Year Old Rye is the rye for you.",

Taylor Straight Rye Whiskey is made from a mash of rye and malted barley. No corn is used in the production of the rye, and, as a result, it has notes of dark spices that are well-balanced with caramel undertones. Bottled in bond at 100 proof, the rye has a dry and oaky finish, that lingers with notes of cinnamon and vanilla.\n\nEach bottle of Colonel E.H.

    "description": "Long gone are the days when Jack Daniel’s was defined only by its staple Old No. 7 Tennessee Whiskey. Over the past few years the lineup of this whiskey brand, one of the most popular in the world, has expanded with interesting new releases, and the latest of these is the new Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye Whiskey.\n\nJack Daniel’s has been on a roll recently, with the launch of 10- and 12-year-old expressions, a single malt whiskey, a bottled-in-bond whiskey, and a combination of three mashbills. And let’s not forget the bottling of one of the highest proof whiskeys you can find on any liquor store shelf, if that’s your thing. Jack first introduced a rye whiskey into its portfolio nearly a decade ago, but as an unconventional limited release of Unaged Rye. After that came Rested Rye, then Single Barrel Rye, and finally Tennessee Rye in 2018. This release marks the first time that Jack Daniel’s rye whiskey has been available in barrel-proof form as part of the Single Barrel collection, which also includes Single Barrel Select, Single Barrel Barrel Proof, and Single Barrel Rye expressions.",

    "description": "Michter's US*1 Single Barrel Straight Rye Whiskey is made from a mash comprised primarily of fresh, plump rye grains. Once the grains are harvested, they are sheared so that during fermentation, the grains are saturated with more flavor. After the grains have been fermented, they are distilled through a copper-pot still before being matured in charred, American oak barrels. The barrels are allowed to rest in a heat-cycled warehouse, which forces the wood to expand and contract as the temperature rises and falls. This heat cycling causes the whiskey and wood to mingle with each other, and contributes notes of marmalade and light caramel to the rye. Once Willie Pratt — Michter's Master Distiller — determines that the rye has reached its peak flavor, each bottle is filled and sealed by hand.\n\nMichter's Single Barrel Straight Rye Whiskey has an aroma of spices, dark fruits, rye bread and vanilla. The aroma gives way to notes of citrus, baked goods, cinnamon and caramel on the palate, which complement touches of herbs and toast. The finish, which is both sweet and warming, ends with a touch of caramel.",

Soon the profits from the distillery greatly exceeded the farm, so that became the core family business when his son Abraham took over. It stayed in the family until 1919. Since then it has been pushed around a bit, but they are one of the few brands that has never compromised on Quality.

    "description": "Kentucky Peerless Distilling Co. traces their roots back to the 1880’s, to the heart of Henderson Kentucky. Peerless Whiskey was founded by a businessman with a bold personality Henry Kraver, who revived the brand from the brink of ruin in the late 1880s. Under Kraver’s guidance, rose from the ashes, increasing production 25-fold. But the growth of the brand was subsequently stunted by the very unforgiving era of Prohibition.\n\nNow, a century later, Peerless Whisky is in the hands of Kraver’s great-grandson Corky Taylor and great-great-grandson Carson Taylor. Keeping Kraver’s legacy alive, the duo has resurrected the brand, even distilling under the original Distilled Spirits Plant number, DSP-KY-50 in a centuries-old warehouse in downtown Louisville, near the Ohio River.\n\nPeerless Whiskey is distilled using a process that values quality over cost. They use a sweet mash, which is costlier than the more commonly used sour mash. The spirit also enters the barrel at a lower 107 proof, which results in the use of 17% more barrels. Water is added before the maturation process as opposed to after, transforming it from a dilutant to an ingredient.\n\nThe straight rye is non-chill filtered and bottled at barrel strength, revealing a robust, authentic, unadulterated whiskey that was ranked No.15 by Whisky Advocate, on their list of Top 20 Whiskies of 2017. Peerless Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey is an incredibly well-balanced whiskey with smooth, sweet notes of brown sugar, oak, and citrus. “We craft our spirits at an unhurried pace, like my great-grandfather did. Only the best bourbon and rye whiskey leaves our doors” says Corky Taylor.",

How do you know they didn’t “recharge” their barrel by dumping a gallon of the previous spirit back into it?

With our process, we are strictly using oak to get its character. Nothing else. I hope that resonates with consumers who don’t know about the inside world of “whiskey specialities” and how we want to establish trust that we aren’t blending in spirits and calling it “finished.”\n\nThanks to Kenny for this illuminating color commentary.

    "description": "A 95% Rye Whiskey that has a depth and complexity normal found in more expensive drams.\n\nRodney \"Rod\" Cegleski was a California surfer when he met an Australian Jackaroo named Hamlisch \"Hammer\" Marshall (a \"jackaroo\" is a young ranch hand down-under). In 2012 they started experimenting with brewing and distilling at the SLO Brew brewery in San Luis Obispo that Hamlisch had purchased. Distilling grew into a passion, and that passion developed into a business. They officially opened Rod & Hammer Slo Stills in 2019 and set about to build.\n\nTo qualify as a Rye Whiskey the law stipulate that the mash bill be a minimum of 51% rye grains. But for Rye Whiskey fans, the minimum will just not do. Rod & Hammer's Slo Stills Straight Rye Whiskey has a mash bill of 95% rye and just enough malted barley to keep that fermentation things running smooth. It’s then barreled in new American oak for two years before being bottled at 45% ABV. The flavor profile is deep and complex, even displaying notes of leather and exotic woods that normally show up in older drams.",

    "description": "WhistlePig The Old World Series: Straight Rye Whiskey Marriage is the culmination of Pickerell’s year-long experiment to pay homage to the fine Scotch and winemakers of the Old World by using various types of European casks to finish his rye. This new release marries together three unique finishes — Madeira (63%), Sauternes (30%) and Port (7%) to create an astounding rye whiskey that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nStraight Rye Whiskey Marriage begins as a 12 year old, 95% rye whiskey distilled at MGP Distillery in Lawrenceburg Indiana. Once it reaches its new home at the WhistlePig Distillery in Vermont, Pickerell finishes the whiskey for three-to-six weeks in barrels that previously contained Madeira, Sauternes and Port.\n\nMadeira is a fortified wine produced since the 17th century on the Portuguese islands of Madeira. WhistlePig The Old World Series: Madeira Finish Rye Whiskey was the first American rye whiskey to ever be finished in such casks.\n\nSauternes is a famous, sweet white wine produced in the French region of Bordeaux. The region’s unique microclimate, which consists of thick morning fog and hot, dry afternoons, causes a “noble rot” to grow on the grapes, imparting its signature flavor unto the wine.\n\nPort, another fortified Portuguese wine, is produced in the Douro Valley, in Portugal’s northern provinces. Similar to brandy, port is rich, sweet and known for its robust flavor.\n\nOnce the rye has matured in its respective cask, the barrels are married together, giving the whiskey a breathtaking aroma filled with marzipan, ripe berries and salted caramel. The palate expands with flavors of dark chocolate, taffy, fruitcake and sugar cereal before leading to a long, dry finish which lingers on the tongue.\n\nWhistlePig The Old World Series Straight Rye Whiskey Marriage won a Double Gold at the 2015 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.",

Just until recently, until his passing the WhistlePig farm had been home to Master Distiller Dave Pickerell.\n\nAfter he graduated from West Point with a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry, Pickerell served in the military for eleven years as a cavalry officer. Later he received a Master's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Louisville, before serving as chairman of the Kentucky Distillers Association and master distiller at Maker's Mark in Loretto, Kentucky for 13 years. \"This is what I was meant for,\" said Pickerell of the whiskey business.\n\nAfter leaving Maker's Mark, Pickerell embarked on a journey to find the perfect rye whiskey. \"Rye, in its own essence, is just a brilliant grain... I wanted to do rye because it's America's historical whiskey.\" During the Revolutionary War, English blockades of American ports prevented the colonists from purchasing molasses used to make rum. As a result, American distillers, including George Washington, started making rye whiskey.\n\nThis stunning 100% rye is one of the final expressions created by late Master Distiller and whiskey luminary Dave Pickerell. His dream was to create the best aged Rye Whiskey perfect for any rye cocktail. PiggyBack has an intensely powerful, spicy profile, imparted by its time in oak barrels. You can expect complex and smooth notes that shine through, yet don’t overpower your drink. An outstanding in any concoction.

They began producing small batch, wheat-based spirits, including gin, vodka, whiskey and bourbon, and while the vodka was the first to start garnering awards, the other spirits didn't followed soon after.\n\nSustainability is an important value at Dry Fly, a grass to grain distillery, where they make it a priority to source the wheat from sustainable farms no farther than a 30-mile radius and to use natural botanicals, grown within the state. Dry Fly also doesn't take shortcuts when it comes to using state of the art equipment and traditional methods. \"The stills are the pretty part,\" says Don Poffenroth as he points to his twin, custom-designed 450-liter Christian Carl copper-pot stills. Manufactured in Goppingen, Germany, the stills traveled over seven thousand miles to Dry Fly Distilling's home in Spokane, Washington, and today, are used to make the distillery's award-winning spirits.\n\nDry Fly Straight Cask Strength Wheat Whiskey is a bolder and stronger version of their Dry Fly Classic. It’s crafted from Dry Fly original 100% wheat whiskey, but instead of bottling it at 90 proof, this one is bottled at cask strength of 120 proof. Aged for over 3 years in new, 53-gallon American oak barrels, this is another beautiful example of Dry Fly wizardry. And don’t let its 120 proof fool you as this award-winning expression drinks much more smoothly than its proof would give away. Almost dangerously smoothly, one might say.",

Each batch is aged for a minimum of two years in a 53-gallen,, charred, brand new American White Oak barrels; it is non-chill filtered in order to preserve the full aromatic complexity of this uniquely American spirit. Deliberate cuts during distillation ensure that this whiskey emerges from its time in barrel as a finely layered and truly distinguished spirit.\n\n \n\nTobacco and butterscotch mingle with a trace of minerality on the nose. A long, smooth sip begins with caramelized sugar, filling out with delicate notes of sweet tea, toasted walnut and juicy stone fruit.

    "description": "Forty years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, George A. Dickel was born in a rural town in eastern Tennessee. By 1867, Dickel was an established Nashville merchant but moved his family to the city of Tullahoma (situated in south-central Tennessee), where he purchased the Cascade Hollow Distillery. After working tirelessly at the distillery, Dickel declared that his spirits were of equal quality to the finest scotch, and followed in the Scottish tradition of spelling whisky without an \"e.\"\n\nWhile George A. Dickel Distillery was forced to close its doors as a result of Prohibition, it was rebuilt in 1958 by Master Distiller Ralph Dupps. To ensure the whisky's authenticity, Dupps obtained the original manuscripts in which Dickel detailed his unique recipe and distillation processes. Today, Master Distiller John Lunn carries on the tradition of excellence that has made Dickel whisky a symbol of quality for over a century.\n\nGeorge Dickel’s newest 13-year-old limited release is bold and balanced. At 100 proof, George Dickel Bottled-in-Bond can be enjoyed neat or on the rocks in addition to being well-suited for many of your favorite cocktails.",

Following distillation, the whisky is distilled and matured for 10-12 years in barrels that have been charred with a #2 char on the heads and a #4 char on the staves (the degree of charring within a barrel is measured on a scale of one to four, with a #1 char referring to casks that have been lightly toasted, and a #4 char referring to casks that have been charred so heavily that the interior resembles an alligator hide). Once the whisky has matured, Master Distiller John Lunn then personally selects 10 barrels to chill and mellow through sugar maple charcoal, which results in a single, very small batch of handcrafted Tennessee whisky.\n\nGeorge Dickel Barrel Select Tennessee Whisky has an aroma of oak, candied nuts and vanilla, all underpinned by a light wood smoke. The palate is filled with caramel, toasted marshmallows, cloves, faint citrus and even mint, and leads to a long, complex finish containing more oak, corn and cinnamon.",

But, this is the standard Jack Daniel’s extremely low rye bourbon mash bill, and while uncut in charcoal-filtered like all Jack Daniel’s whiskey.  \n\nThe color is an amazing mahogany color – this whiskey is so incredibly red that it is more comparable with whiskies much older. Gravity-defying oily legs on the swirl. The nose is incredible – dark cane syrup, Amerena cherries, with hints of vanilla, dark chocolate, and dark caramel. On the palate, you would not guess this was over seventy percent alcohol. Very rich mouthfeel, and drinks more like 120 proof. Juicy Amerena cherries, dark chocolate, rich Latakia and Perique pipe tobacco, baking spices, and clove are present on the palate, with lovely oak in the background that is not overly done. On the finish the cherries fade and the clove mingles with the oak tannin, which starts out big then decrescendos to a drying oak mild finish before lingering for a long time.",

It has a fair bit of burn on the tongue at first, but once I let it sit on my palate for a few seconds the honey and molasses flavors washed through my mouth like a beautiful sunrise.  A few more seconds brought a bit of the tannin’s forward and then the mellowing of the Maple Charcoal washed away the wood flavor so it didn’t get too acidic.  The finish, definitely strong on the oak and maple flavors, wasn’t as long as I have become accustomed to, about 20-25 seconds and a slightly bitter aftertaste, but overall a pleasant dram.",

It has a fair bit of burn on the tongue at first, but once I let it sit on my palate for a few seconds the honey and molasses flavors washed through my mouth like a beautiful sunrise.  A few more seconds brought a bit of the tannin’s forward and then the mellowing of the Maple Charcoal washed away the wood flavor so it didn’t get too acidic.  The finish, definitely strong on the oak and maple flavors, wasn’t as long as I have become accustomed to, about 20-25 seconds and a slightly bitter aftertaste, but overall a pleasant dram.",

    "description": "Like America itself, American Harvest was built on a promise. From field to bottle, a promise to create the finest quality product, without compromise to the environment or our nations natural resources. American Harvest is proudly handcrafted in small batches from organic American wheat, certified organic ingredients and water from deep beneath the Snake River Plain, yielding a distinctly smooth and silky spirit with a crisp, clean taste. What is American Harvest? Distinct taste: American Harvest is organic vodka to which a proprietary blend of organic ingredients has been added, creating a truly unique vodka specialty. Its a revolutionary way to look at the vodka category. The addition of these ingredients results in a distinctive, smooth, clean and crisp character. American made: American Harvest is handcrafted in small batches from organic winter wheat grown on a family owned and sustainably managed American farm, and from water from aquifers deep beneath the Snake River plain. Quality: American Harvest has been developed with great care for the quality, organic nature and sustainable growing practices of all of its ingredients. It has no artificial additives or preservatives. The American Harvest Distillery located in Rigby, Idaho is independently owned and operated and is USDA Certified Organic. Why Organic? Organic is a symbol of a premium, quality product and is a point of differentiation in spirits. US sales of organic food and beverages have grown from $1 billion in 1990 to $24.8 billion in 2009 and are continuing to rise at a rate of over 5% per year. How is American Harvest Supporting the Environment? Sustainable agriculture: The producers of American Harvest support sustainable agriculture by using organic materials and an organic production process. Wind power: The American Harvest Distillery supports renewable energy. One-third of the monthly electrical consumption at the distillery comes from local wind generated power. Additionally, unused materials from the distillation process are used as cattle feed along with most of the water. Recyclable glass: The American Harvest bottle manufacturer is dedicated to a sustainable development approach and to preserving natural resources through the efficient use of raw materials, water and energy. American Harvest bottles are 100% recyclable and are coated and decorated with organic inks and water-soluble varnishes.",

First is the sweet corn sourced from northwestern farms, and second is the exceptionally pure water of the Cascade Mountains. The waters of this range flow through riverbeds of lava rock, and thereby avoid picking the sediment—metallic salts such as magnesium and calcium—present in most water sources. In fact, our waters contain 90% less of these compounds than your average drinking water. This makes our water remarkably 'soft', and results in Anestasia vodka’s naturally derived purity. Once harvested, our corn grains are mixed with fermenting sugars and yeast—then distilled five times. This distillate is then blended down with our uniquely pure water before being filtered a further five times through crushed lava rock, neutral charcoal, and Arkansas-derived quartz crystal. This filtration process removes any remaining impurities, often including the congeners which can cause hangovers. The final result is fresh, easy-to-drink vodka that is both lightly weighted and very smooth.",

Karlsson’s uses a variety of seven different virgin Swedish new potatoes to make their Karlsson’s Gold Vodka. The result is a delicious vodka with light tones of chocolate and black pepper. Karlsson’s Gold is one of our favorite sipping vodkas and one of the best examples of how a vodka can be flavorful and have great character.\n\nKarlsson’s continues to expand what’s considered vodka and has ventured into the relatively new frontier of vintage vodka. With the Karlsson’s Batch 2008 Vodka, the company has picked one of the seven potatoes used to make Karlsson’s Gold Vodka and showcased it individually. The potato used is the Gammel Svenske Rod, a round potato with a red-violet skin and yellow pulp with flames of red. The potato itself is mellow with sweet undertones similar in character to the Jerusalem artichoke. It takes a staggering 18 pounds of these potatoes to make a single bottle of Karlsson’s Batch 2008 Vodka.",

Tito’s Handmade Vodka is designed to be savored by both spirit connoisseurs and those who enjoy a simple cocktail. The gluten-free vodka is distilled using old-fashioned copper pot stills, inspired by the distillation methods of fine single malt scotches and high-end French cognacs. Made in batches with each batch taste-tested, Tito’s goes down smooth and has an impeccably clean finish. From a Bloody Mary at brunch to a martini at cocktail hour, just add Tito’s and enjoy. Distilled and bottled on the same land where it all started in Austin, Texas, Tito’s Handmade Vodka is made from 100% corn and is naturally gluten-free.",

    "description": "Rodney \"Rod\" Cegleski was a California surfer when he met an Australian Jackaroo named Hamlisch \"Hammer\" Marshall (a \"jackaroo\" is a young ranch hand down-under). In 2012 they started experimenting with brewing and distilling at the SLO Brew brewery in San Luis Obispo that Hamlisch had purchased. Distilling grew into a passion, and that passion developed into a business. They officially opened Rod & Hammer Slo Stills in 2019 and set about to build.\n\nThere are a lot of distillers who start with the clear Spirits. Makes sense — you generate a little cash while waiting for the Whiskey to age. But Rod & Hammer's are doing this a bit in the reverse. You see, they noticed that the wonder-liquid coming off the stills was just one step away from becoming a delicious and refreshing California Vodka. And to keep things fun, they cut it to proof using desalinated water from the nearby Pacific Ocean. Fortunately, they have put some aside for us. Meet Rod & Hammer's Slo Stills Slo Vodka.",

In 2013 they were designated as a National Historic Landmark, joining an elite group of the most influential places in North America.\n\nThe Buffalo Trace White Dog Mash #1 is an un-aged, unflavored Whiskey distillate that is bottled directly at barrel strength, thus preserving the full taste of a White Whiskey and making it the closest thing to a \"legal\" Moonshine. White Whiskey is also known as White Dog, White Mash, New Make and even White Lightning — a name referring to the jolt of lightning that follows after tasting it, and at 62.5% ABV there will be some lightning, for sure.
